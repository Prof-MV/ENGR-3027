Defining and identifying manufacturing processes is critical to understanding the role that automation plays and how to program an industrial process line. What are some examples of a manufacturing process? What do we have or use that is manufactured? What is the biggest manufacturing change that you have experienced so far? Processes have changed throughout the centuries and have been driven by the four Industrial Revolutions. First Industrial Revolution – Coal in 1765 This transformed society from an agricultural base to an industrial base. Processes became mechanized and rather than hand made, products were manufactured. The discovery of coal and the development of the steam engine and metal forging transformed the way goods were created. Second Industrial Revolution – Gas in 1870 *The discovery of oil and electricity fueled the second industrial revolution. The discovery of oil lead to the invention of the combustion engine and new steel and chemical based products entered the manufacturing streams. Technological advances in communication were driven by the invention of the telegraph and later the telephone. Modes of transportation developed with the invention of the airplane and automobile. These discoveries helped to drive the advent of mass production which forever changed how items were produced. Third Industrial Revolution – Electronics and Nuclear Energy in 1969 The third industrial revolution is dominated by the development of electronics and the beginning of the age of computers. Technological developments were centered around four pillars of science: telecommunications, biotechnology, information technology and energy engineering. Fourth Industrial Revolution – Internet and AI The fourth industrial revolution describes the current era of digitalization, automation, and advanced manufacturing technology. It’s characterized by the convergence of emerging technologies, such as robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 3D printing.

Manufacturing processes are the specific methods used for this conversion. Based on product requirements, different types of manufacturing processes are selected to achieve the required output with optimal cost, quality, and efficiency. ## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was ## deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0. ## ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead. ## This warning is displayed once per ## session. ## Call ## `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` ## to see where this warning was ## generated. Figure 1.1: Overview of Manufacturing Process Categories Why do we need different manufacturing processes? Different products require different manufacturing approaches based on: Material type: Metals, plastics, ceramics, composites Production volume: One-off prototypes vs. millions of units Geometric complexity: Simple shapes vs. intricate details Precision requirements: Loose tolerances vs. micron-level accuracy Cost constraints: Budget limitations affect process selection Lead time: How quickly parts are needed No single process is optimal for all situations! A good video summarizing 6 of the 7 manufacturing processes is linked below (Coating/Plating is not covered): 1.3 Process Selection Framework Before examining each process type, it’s important to understand how engineers select the right manufacturing process. The following visualization shows the key factors: Figure 1.2: Process Selection Based on Volume and Complexity Table 1.1: Manufacturing Process Comparison Summary Process Type Typical Materials Production Volume Typical Tolerance Tooling Cost Unit Cost at Volume Casting Metals, alloys Low to High ±0.5-2mm Medium-High Low Molding Plastics, rubber Medium to Very High ±0.1-0.5mm High Very Low Forming Metals, sheet Medium to Very High ±0.1-1mm Medium-High Low Machining All materials Low to Medium ±0.01-0.1mm Low High Joining All materials All volumes Varies Low Medium Coating All materials All volumes N/A Low Low Additive Plastics, metals, ceramics Prototype to Low ±0.1-0.3mm None High 1.4 1. Casting Processes Casting is a process of pouring liquid metal into a mold containing the hollow shape of the desired outcome. It uses sprue, gates, and runners to direct the molten metal flow. Figure 1.3: Comparison of Casting Processes 1.4.1 Sand Casting Sand casting is a metal casting process that uses sand as the mold material. This process has a low production rate as the sand mold must be destroyed to remove the part. However, it is economical for low-volume production. Process Steps: Create a pattern (usually wood or metal) Pack sand around the pattern to form the mold Remove the pattern, leaving a cavity Pour molten metal into the cavity Allow solidification Break the sand mold to remove the casting Advantages: Low tooling cost, can produce very large parts, suitable for all metals Disadvantages: Poor surface finish, loose tolerances, slow cycle time Examples: Engine blocks, machine tool bases, cylinder heads, pump housings, large gears Discussion: Why is sand casting still widely used despite its limitations? Sand casting remains popular because: Low startup cost - A wood pattern costs hundreds vs. steel dies costing tens of thousands Flexibility - Easy to modify patterns for design changes Size capability - Can cast parts weighing several tons Material versatility - Works with nearly any metal Short lead time - Parts can be produced in days vs. weeks for die casting For prototypes and low-volume production (&lt; 500 parts), sand casting is often the most economical choice even with its lower quality. 1.4.2 Die Casting Die casting is used for producing metal parts where high precision is required. Molten metal is forced under high pressure into reusable metal dies, enabling high-volume production. Process: Steel molds (dies) are machined to the part shape Dies are mounted in a die casting machine Molten metal is injected under high pressure (10-175 MPa) Metal solidifies rapidly due to die cooling Part is ejected and the cycle repeats Advantages: Excellent dimensional accuracy, smooth surface finish, high production rates (up to 400 shots/hour) Disadvantages: High die cost ($50,000-$500,000), limited to non-ferrous metals, porosity issues Examples: Engine components, transmission housings, electronic enclosures, power tool housings 1.4.3 Investment Casting (Lost-Wax) Investment casting produces complex, precision parts by creating a wax pattern that is “invested” (surrounded) with ceramic slurry, then melted out to leave a mold cavity. Advantages: Excellent surface finish, tight tolerances (±0.1%), complex geometries, any castable metal Disadvantages: Expensive, slow cycle time, limited part size Examples: Turbine blades, aerospace components, medical implants, jewelry, firearm components Why do aerospace companies pay premium prices for investment casting? Investment casting is essential for aerospace because: Complex internal passages - Turbine blades have intricate cooling channels Superior metallurgy - Controlled solidification produces better grain structure Near-net shape - Minimizes machining of expensive superalloys Weight savings - Can create hollow structures impossible with other methods Material options - Works with titanium, Inconel, and other aerospace alloys A single turbine blade might cost $1,000-$5,000, but there’s no other process that can produce the required geometry and performance. 1.4.4 Centrifugal Casting Centrifugal casting spins molten metal in a rotating die, using centrifugal force to distribute the metal and float impurities to the inner surface. Applications: Pipes, tubes, cylinder liners, bushings, rings 1.4.5 Permanent Mold Casting Uses reusable metal molds with gravity or low-pressure filling. Good for medium-volume production of aluminum and copper alloy parts. Applications: Pistons, gear housings, wheels, pipe fittings 1.4.6 Shell Molding Uses resin-coated sand that forms a thin, strong shell around a heated pattern. Better dimensional accuracy than sand casting. Applications: Gear housings, cylinder heads, connecting rods 1.5 2. Molding Processes Molding uses a rigid frame to shape hot liquid or ductile raw material. It is predominantly used for plastics and rubber products. Figure 1.4: Molding Process Selection by Production Volume 1.5.1 Injection Molding Injection molding is the most common process for manufacturing plastic parts. Plastic pellets are melted and injected under high pressure into a mold cavity. Process Cycle: Clamping - Mold halves are clamped together Injection - Molten plastic is injected into the cavity Cooling - Part solidifies in the mold Ejection - Part is pushed out by ejector pins Cycle times: 10-60 seconds typical, as fast as 2 seconds for small parts Examples: Automotive dashboards, phone cases, medical devices, food containers, toys # Injection Molding Cost Analysis Example # Comparing costs at different production volumes mold_cost &lt;- 50000 # Typical mold cost in dollars material_cost_per_kg &lt;- 2.50 # ABS plastic part_weight_kg &lt;- 0.1 cycle_time_sec &lt;- 30 machine_rate_per_hour &lt;- 75 # Machine + operator cost # Calculate cost per part at different volumes volumes &lt;- c(1000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 500000) cost_analysis &lt;- data.frame( Volume = volumes, Mold_Per_Part = mold_cost / volumes, Material = part_weight_kg * material_cost_per_kg, Processing = (cycle_time_sec / 3600) * machine_rate_per_hour ) cost_analysis$Total_Per_Part &lt;- cost_analysis$Mold_Per_Part + cost_analysis$Material + cost_analysis$Processing cat(&quot;Injection Molding Cost Breakdown:\\n&quot;) ## Injection Molding Cost Breakdown: cat(&quot;================================\\n&quot;) ## ================================ for(i in 1:nrow(cost_analysis)) { cat(sprintf(&quot;At %s parts: $%.2f per part (Tooling: $%.2f, Material: $%.2f, Processing: $%.2f)\\n&quot;, format(cost_analysis$Volume[i], big.mark=&quot;,&quot;), cost_analysis$Total_Per_Part[i], cost_analysis$Mold_Per_Part[i], cost_analysis$Material[i], cost_analysis$Processing[i])) } ## At 1,000 parts: $50.88 per part (Tooling: $50.00, Material: $0.25, Processing: $0.62) ## At 10,000 parts: $5.88 per part (Tooling: $5.00, Material: $0.25, Processing: $0.62) ## At 50,000 parts: $1.88 per part (Tooling: $1.00, Material: $0.25, Processing: $0.62) ## At 1e+05 parts: $1.38 per part (Tooling: $0.50, Material: $0.25, Processing: $0.62) ## At 5e+05 parts: $0.97 per part (Tooling: $0.10, Material: $0.25, Processing: $0.62) Discussion: When does injection molding become cost-effective vs. 3D printing? Break-even analysis: 3D printing: ~$5-20 per part (no tooling, slow production) Injection molding: $50,000 tooling + $0.50-2 per part Break-even point: Approximately 5,000-10,000 parts Rule of thumb: - &lt; 500 parts: 3D printing or machining - 500-5,000 parts: Consider soft tooling (aluminum molds) - &gt; 5,000 parts: Steel injection molds become economical 1.5.2 Blow Molding Blow molding creates hollow plastic parts by inflating a heated plastic tube (parison) inside a mold cavity. Types: - Extrusion blow molding - Parison extruded, then blown - Injection blow molding - Preform injection molded, then blown - Stretch blow molding - Preform stretched and blown (PET bottles) Examples: Bottles, containers, fuel tanks, automotive ducts, toys 1.5.3 Rotational Molding Creates hollow parts by rotating a mold on two axes while heating, causing plastic powder to melt and coat the interior surface. Advantages: Low tooling cost, no internal stresses, large hollow parts Examples: Kayaks, playground equipment, tanks, coolers 1.5.4 Thermoforming Heats a plastic sheet until pliable, then forms it over a mold using vacuum, pressure, or mechanical force. Examples: Packaging (blister packs), disposable cups, refrigerator liners 1.5.5 Powder Metallurgy Though involving metal, powder metallurgy uses molding principles. Metal powders are compacted in dies and sintered (heated below melting point) to fuse particles. Advantages: Near-net shape, complex geometries, controlled porosity Examples: Self-lubricating bearings, gears, filters, magnets 1.6 3. Forming Processes Forming uses mechanical forces (compression, tension, shear) to shape material without removing any material. This preserves material grain structure and can improve mechanical properties. Figure 1.5: Types of Forming Forces 1.6.1 Forging Forging uses compressive forces from hammers or presses to shape heated metal. Forged parts have superior strength due to aligned grain structure. Types of Forging: - Open-die forging - Simple shapes, large parts - Closed-die (impression) forging - Complex shapes, high volume - Cold forging - Room temperature, excellent finish - Hot forging - Heated material, easier deformation Examples: Crankshafts, connecting rods, gears, aircraft structural components, hand tools Why are aircraft landing gear forgings so expensive? Aircraft landing gear forgings can cost $100,000+ because: Material - High-strength steel or titanium alloys Size - Large parts require massive presses (50,000+ tons) Certification - Extensive testing and documentation Grain flow - Must be optimized for fatigue resistance NDT requirements - 100% ultrasonic and magnetic particle inspection Low volume - Only a few hundred per aircraft type per year The forged grain structure provides 20-40% better fatigue life than equivalent castings or machined parts. 1.6.2 Stamping Stamping uses dies and presses to form, cut, or shape sheet metal. Modern stamping lines can produce 1,000+ parts per hour. Operations include: - Blanking - Cutting flat shapes from sheet - Piercing - Punching holes - Drawing - Forming cup shapes - Bending - Creating angles - Coining - Fine detail forming Examples: Automotive body panels, appliance housings, electronic enclosures 1.6.3 Bending Bending uses press brakes to create angular shapes in sheet metal. Key formula: \\[\\text{Bend Allowance} = \\frac{\\pi \\times A \\times (R + K \\times T)}{180}\\] Where: A = bend angle, R = inside radius, T = material thickness, K = K-factor (typically 0.3-0.5) 1.6.4 Shearing Shearing cuts sheet metal without chip formation using opposed cutting edges. Types: Blanking, piercing, trimming, notching, slitting 1.6.5 Rolling Reduces material thickness by passing through rotating rolls. Used for sheet, plate, and structural shapes. 1.6.6 Extrusion (Metal) Forces material through a die to create constant cross-section profiles. Examples: Aluminum window frames, heat sinks, structural shapes 1.7 4. Machining Processes Machining removes material using cutting tools to achieve precise dimensions and surface finishes. It is the most versatile manufacturing process but typically has higher per-part costs. Figure 1.6: Machining Process Capabilities 1.7.1 Turning Rotates the workpiece while a cutting tool moves to create cylindrical shapes. Performed on lathes or turning centers Operations: Facing, turning, boring, threading, grooving, parting 1.7.2 Milling Rotates a cutting tool while moving the workpiece to remove material. The most versatile machining process. Types: - Peripheral milling - Cutter axis parallel to surface - Face milling - Cutter axis perpendicular to surface - End milling - Creates slots, pockets, contours 1.7.3 Drilling Creates cylindrical holes using rotating drill bits. Related operations: Reaming (sizing), boring (enlarging), tapping (threading) 1.7.4 Grinding Uses abrasive wheels for precision finishing. Achieves the finest tolerances and surface finishes. Types: Surface grinding, cylindrical grinding, centerless grinding 1.7.5 Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) Uses electrical sparks to erode conductive materials. Essential for hardened materials and complex geometries. Applications: Injection mold cavities, dies, aerospace components When should you use EDM instead of conventional machining? Choose EDM when: Hardened materials - Can machine 60+ HRC steels that would destroy cutting tools Complex internal features - Wire EDM cuts intricate shapes Tight corners - Can achieve sharp internal corners impossible with rotary tools Fragile parts - No cutting forces (non-contact process) Thin walls - No deflection from tool pressure Limitations: - Slow material removal (grams/hour vs. kg/hour for milling) - Only works on conductive materials - Recast layer may need removal - Higher cost per part 1.8 5. Joining Processes Joining combines two or more components into a single assembly. Methods range from permanent (welding) to removable (fasteners). Table 1.2: Joining Process Comparison Process Joint Strength Dissimilar Metals Automation Typical Applications Arc Welding Excellent Limited Medium Structural steel, pressure vessels Resistance Welding Excellent Limited High Auto body panels, wire mesh Laser Welding Excellent Limited High Electronics, medical devices Brazing Good Yes Medium Carbide tooling, HVAC Soldering Fair Yes High Electronics, plumbing Adhesive Bonding Good Yes High Composites, glass, plastics Mechanical Fastening Excellent Yes High All industries 1.8.1 Welding Melts and fuses base materials together, often with added filler metal. Common Types: - MIG (GMAW) - Gas Metal Arc Welding - fast, easy automation - TIG (GTAW) - Gas Tungsten Arc Welding - precise, clean welds - Stick (SMAW) - Shielded Metal Arc Welding - versatile, field use - Resistance - Uses electrical resistance heating - Laser/Electron Beam - High precision, deep penetration 1.8.2 Brazing and Soldering Joins metals using a filler metal with a lower melting point than the base materials. The base materials do not melt. Brazing - Filler melts above 450°C (840°F) Soldering - Filler melts below 450°C 1.8.3 Adhesive Bonding Uses chemical adhesives to join materials. Essential for composites, glass, and dissimilar materials. Advantages: Distributes stress, joins dissimilar materials, seals against fluids Disadvantages: Surface preparation critical, limited temperature resistance, aging concerns 1.8.4 Mechanical Fastening Uses bolts, screws, rivets, or clips. Allows disassembly for maintenance. 1.9 6. Surface Treatment and Coating Coating and surface treatment processes protect parts from corrosion, wear, or environmental damage, and can improve appearance or electrical properties. Table 1.3: Surface Treatment and Coating Processes Process Typical Thickness Base Material Primary Benefit Industry Electroplating 1-50 μm Conductive metals Corrosion, appearance Automotive, electronics Anodizing 5-100 μm Aluminum Corrosion, hardness Aerospace, construction Powder Coating 50-150 μm Any metal Corrosion, appearance Appliances, furniture Painting 25-75 μm Any Appearance All Hot Dip Galvanizing 45-85 μm Steel Corrosion Construction, automotive PVD/CVD 1-10 μm Any Wear, hardness Tooling, aerospace Thermal Spray 100-500 μm Any Wear, thermal barrier Aerospace, energy 1.9.1 Electroplating Deposits metal coating using electrical current. Common coatings include chrome, nickel, zinc, gold, and silver. 1.9.2 Anodizing Electrochemically grows an oxide layer on aluminum. Provides corrosion resistance and can be dyed various colors. 1.9.3 Powder Coating Applies dry powder electrostatically, then cures with heat. Produces thick, durable, attractive finishes. 1.9.4 Galvanizing Coats steel with zinc for corrosion protection. Hot-dip galvanizing provides excellent outdoor durability. 1.10 7. Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) Additive manufacturing builds parts layer-by-layer from digital models. It’s the opposite of machining (subtractive manufacturing). Figure 1.7: Additive Manufacturing Process Comparison 1.10.1 FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) Extrudes thermoplastic filament through a heated nozzle. Most common desktop 3D printing technology. Materials: PLA, ABS, PETG, Nylon, TPU 1.10.2 SLA (Stereolithography) Uses UV laser to cure liquid photopolymer resin. Excellent surface finish and detail. 1.10.3 SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) Fuses powder material with a laser. Produces strong functional parts without support structures. 1.10.4 Metal 3D Printing (DMLS/SLM) Fuses metal powder with high-power lasers. Used for aerospace, medical, and tooling applications. When does metal 3D printing make sense vs. traditional manufacturing? Metal 3D printing is advantageous when: Complex internal features - Conformal cooling channels in molds Topology optimization - Organic shapes that minimize weight Consolidation - Combining multiple parts into one Low volume - Too few parts to justify tooling Custom/one-off - Medical implants, prototypes Traditional manufacturing is better when: - High volumes (&gt; 100-1000 parts depending on complexity) - Simple geometries - Large parts (3D print beds are limited) - Maximum strength required (forging still superior) Cost comparison: - Simple bracket: $5 machined vs. $50+ 3D printed - Complex aerospace part: $10,000 machined vs. $3,000 3D printed 1.11 Industry Applications Table 1.4: Manufacturing Process Applications by Industry Process Automotive Food Industry Defense/Aerospace Die Casting Engine blocks, transmission cases Equipment housings Aircraft structural components Injection Molding Dashboard, interior trim, connectors Packaging, containers, caps Connectors, housings, switches Forging Crankshafts, connecting rods, gears Mixer blades, pump impellers Landing gear, turbine disks Stamping Body panels, structural components Cans, trays, lids Aircraft skins, missile bodies Machining Engine components, precision parts Valves, fittings Precision weapons components Welding Body structure, exhaust systems Tanks, piping, conveyors Aircraft structures, armor Powder Coating Wheels, chassis components Equipment frames Military vehicles, equipment 3D Printing Prototypes, custom fixtures Custom tooling, fixtures Turbine blades, brackets, tooling 1.12 Sustainability in Manufacturing Modern manufacturing must consider environmental impact. Here’s how different processes compare: Figure 1.8: Environmental Considerations by Process Type Discussion: How can manufacturers reduce environmental impact? Strategies for sustainable manufacturing: Near-net-shape processes - Casting, forging, and molding reduce machining waste Closed-loop recycling - Reprocess scrap material on-site Energy-efficient equipment - Modern machines use 30-50% less energy Additive manufacturing - Only uses material where needed Water-based coatings - Replace solvent-based paints Lean manufacturing - Reduces overproduction and waste Life cycle assessment - Consider total environmental impact Example: Aluminum die casting recycles 95%+ of sprues and runners, while machining from billet may waste 80% of material. 1.13 Review Questions Question 1: Process Identification A company needs to produce 50,000 aluminum housings per year. Each housing is a complex shape with internal fins for heat dissipation. The surface must be smooth and dimensions must be within ±0.3mm. Which process would you recommend? Answer: Die Casting is the best choice because: - High volume (50,000/year) justifies tooling cost - Aluminum is ideal for die casting - Complex internal features are possible - ±0.3mm tolerance is achievable - Good surface finish without secondary operations Alternative: If volumes were lower (&lt; 5,000), investment casting might be considered. Question 2: Cost Comparison Calculate the break-even point between 3D printing and injection molding for a small plastic part: - 3D printing: $8 per part (no tooling) - Injection molding: $25,000 mold + $0.50 per part Answer: Let n = number of parts Break-even: $8n = $25,000 + $0.50n $7.50n = $25,000 n = 3,333 parts Below 3,333 parts: 3D printing is cheaper Above 3,333 parts: Injection molding is cheaper At 10,000 parts: - 3D printing: $80,000 - Injection molding: $30,000 Question 3: Material Selection Match each material/product to the most appropriate manufacturing process: Stainless steel surgical instrument Large plastic kayak Titanium jet engine bracket Aluminum beverage can Answers: Investment casting or machining - Complex shapes, high precision, excellent surface finish Rotational molding - Large hollow plastic part, low tooling cost Additive manufacturing (DMLS) or forging - Complex geometry, lightweight, strength critical Deep drawing (stamping) - Very high volume, thin-wall cylinder Question 4: Process Selection Scenario You need to manufacture a new product with these requirements: - Quantity: 200 units for initial market test - Material: ABS plastic - Size: 150mm × 100mm × 50mm - Tolerance: ±0.5mm - Surface: Smooth, will be painted What process would you recommend and why? Answer: 3D Printing (FDM or SLA) would be most appropriate because: Low quantity (200) - Injection molding tooling ($30,000+) not justified Market test phase - Design may change based on feedback Quick turnaround - Parts in days vs. weeks for tooling Tolerances achievable - ±0.5mm is within FDM capabilities Post-processing acceptable - Parts will be painted anyway Cost comparison: - FDM: 200 × $15 = $3,000 - Injection molding: $30,000 + (200 × $1) = $30,200 If the product succeeds and volume increases to 10,000+, transition to injection molding. Question 5: Hybrid Manufacturing What is hybrid manufacturing and when is it used? Answer: Hybrid manufacturing combines additive and subtractive processes in a single machine or workflow. Common combinations: - 3D print near-net shape → CNC machine critical surfaces - Cast blank → Machine precision features - Forge rough shape → Machine final dimensions Benefits: - Reduced material waste vs. pure machining - Better precision than pure additive - Faster than pure machining for complex parts Example: Aerospace companies 3D print titanium brackets, then machine mounting surfaces to achieve tight tolerances. This can reduce material waste by 90% compared to machining from billet. 1.14 Summary Table 1.5: Manufacturing Processes Summary Process Category Key Principle Best For Typical Industries Casting Pour liquid into mold Complex metal shapes, medium-high volume Automotive, aerospace Molding Shape heated/softened material Plastic parts, very high volume Consumer products, packaging Forming Deform solid with force Strong metal parts, high volume Automotive, construction Machining Remove material with tools Precision parts, any material All industries Joining Combine multiple parts Assembly of components All industries Coating Apply protective layer Corrosion/wear protection All industries Additive Build layer by layer Prototypes, complex geometry Aerospace, medical, prototyping 1.14.1 Key Takeaways No single process is best for everything - Selection depends on material, volume, complexity, and cost constraints Volume drives economics - High tooling costs require high volumes to amortize Consider the complete supply chain - Secondary operations, assembly, and finishing affect total cost Sustainability matters - Modern manufacturing must minimize waste and energy use Hybrid approaches are growing - Combining processes optimizes cost and performance 1.15 References Groover, M.P.

Process engineers are responsible for: Designing production processes - Selecting equipment, defining sequences, optimizing flow Improving existing processes - Reducing waste, increasing throughput, improving quality Scaling up from lab to production - Taking R&amp;D concepts to full-scale manufacturing Ensuring safety and compliance - Meeting regulatory and environmental requirements Supporting production - Troubleshooting issues, training operators Cost optimization - Reducing manufacturing costs while maintaining quality 2.3 Types of Manufacturing Automation Automation is essential for achieving high productivity, consistent quality, and competitive manufacturing costs. There are three fundamental types of automation, each suited to different production scenarios. Figure 2.1: Comparison of Automation Types 2.3.1 Fixed Automation Fixed automation (also called “hard automation”) uses specialized equipment designed for a specific product. The sequence of operations is determined by the equipment configuration and cannot be easily changed. Characteristics: - Very high production rates (thousands per hour) - Low per-unit cost at high volumes - High initial capital investment - Inflexible - dedicated to one product Examples: - Automotive transfer lines for engine blocks - Beverage bottling lines - Chemical processing plants - Paper manufacturing # Fixed Automation Economic Analysis # When does fixed automation make sense? # Example: Automotive transfer line for cylinder heads fixed_automation_cost &lt;- 5000000 # Initial equipment cost annual_production &lt;- 500000 # Parts per year fixed_cost_per_part &lt;- 2.50 # Operating cost per part equipment_life_years &lt;- 10 # Calculate total cost per part including amortization annual_equipment_cost &lt;- fixed_automation_cost / equipment_life_years total_annual_cost &lt;- annual_equipment_cost + (fixed_cost_per_part * annual_production) cost_per_part &lt;- total_annual_cost / annual_production cat(&quot;Fixed Automation Analysis:\\n&quot;) ## Fixed Automation Analysis: cat(&quot;==========================\\n&quot;) ## ========================== cat(sprintf(&quot;Equipment cost: $%s\\n&quot;, format(fixed_automation_cost, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;))) ## Equipment cost: $5e+06 cat(sprintf(&quot;Annual production: %s parts\\n&quot;, format(annual_production, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;))) ## Annual production: 5e+05 parts cat(sprintf(&quot;Operating cost per part: $%.2f\\n&quot;, fixed_cost_per_part)) ## Operating cost per part: $2.50 cat(sprintf(&quot;Amortized equipment cost per part: $%.2f\\n&quot;, annual_equipment_cost/annual_production)) ## Amortized equipment cost per part: $1.00 cat(sprintf(&quot;Total cost per part: $%.2f\\n&quot;, cost_per_part)) ## Total cost per part: $3.50 2.3.2 Programmable Automation Programmable automation allows the production equipment to be reprogrammed for different products. It’s suited for batch production where products change periodically. Characteristics: - Medium production rates - Significant changeover time between products - Lower initial cost than fixed automation - Suitable for batch sizes of 100-10,000 Examples: - CNC machining centers - Industrial robots - PLC-controlled assembly machines - Batch chemical reactors Discussion: When should you choose programmable over fixed automation? Choose programmable automation when: Product variety - You make multiple products on the same equipment Volume uncertainty - Demand may shift between products Product evolution - Frequent design changes expected Lower volumes - Not enough volume to justify dedicated equipment Capital constraints - Can’t afford multiple dedicated lines Example scenario: A machine shop that makes 20 different part numbers for aerospace customers would use CNC machines (programmable) rather than dedicated transfer lines (fixed) because: - Volumes per part number are low (100-1,000/year) - New part designs are introduced regularly - Flexibility to respond to customer changes is critical 2.3.3 Flexible Automation Flexible automation can produce a variety of parts with minimal changeover time. It combines the flexibility of programmable automation with the productivity approaching fixed automation. Characteristics: - Medium-high production rates - Very fast changeover (minutes, not hours) - High initial investment - Suitable for medium variety, medium volume Examples: - Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) - Robotic assembly cells - Automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems - Modern automotive final assembly lines Table 2.1: Automation Type Selection Guide Production Characteristic Fixed Automation Programmable Automation Flexible Automation Annual Volume &gt; 1,000,000 units 1,000 - 100,000 units 10,000 - 500,000 units Product Variety Single product Several products in batches Many products, mixed Changeover Frequency Rarely (years) Weekly to monthly Hours to minutes Initial Investment Very High ($5M+) Medium ($500K-$2M) High ($2M-$10M) Operating Cost Lowest per unit Medium per unit Low-medium per unit Best Industries Automotive, Beverage, Chemical Job shops, Aerospace, Medical Electronics, Automotive suppliers List industries where you can find various automated process systems By automation type: Fixed Automation: - Oil refineries - Chemical plants - Food processing (high-volume) - Beverage bottling - Automotive powertrain - Steel mills - Paper/pulp mills Programmable Automation: - Aerospace manufacturing - Medical device production - Pharmaceutical (batch) - Job shops - Tool &amp; die making - Defense contractors Flexible Automation: - Electronics assembly - Automotive final assembly - Warehouse/distribution - Semiconductor fabrication - Consumer appliances - Furniture manufacturing 2.3.4 Automation Advantages and Disadvantages Table 2.2: Advantages and Disadvantages of Manufacturing Automation Category Point Advantages Lowered Operating Costs - Reduced labor per unit Advantages Improved Worker Safety - Removes humans from hazardous operations Advantages Reduced Factory Lead Times - Faster, more predictable production Advantages Increased Production Output - 24/7 operation possible Advantages Smaller Environmental Footprint - Optimized resource usage Advantages Increased Productivity and Efficiency - Consistent cycle times Advantages Increased System Versatility - Modern systems adapt to changes Disadvantages Higher Start-up Cost - Significant capital investment required Disadvantages Higher Cost of Maintenance - Specialized technicians needed Disadvantages Obsolescence/Depreciation - Technology changes rapidly Disadvantages Workforce Displacement - Fewer direct labor jobs Disadvantages Not Economical for Small Scale - Minimum volumes required 2.4 Project Development Phases Manufacturing projects follow a structured development process from initial concept to full operation. Understanding these phases is essential for process engineers. Figure 2.2: Project Development Phases and Gate Reviews 2.4.1 Phase 1: Concept Development The initial phase defines the project scope, evaluates feasibility, and develops preliminary cost estimates.

Figure 2.3: Common P&amp;ID Symbols (Simplified) Table 2.6: ISA Instrument Tag Structure First Letter Measured Variable Modifier Letters Example Tag F Flow T = Transmitter FT-101 (Flow Transmitter) L Level C = Controller LC-201 (Level Controller) P Pressure I = Indicator PI-301 (Pressure Indicator) T Temperature E = Element/Sensor TE-401 (Temperature Element) A Analysis V = Valve AT-501 (Analyzer Transmitter) S Speed A = Alarm SI-601 (Speed Indicator) Quick Quiz: Decode these instrument tags Decode the following P&amp;ID tags: FIC-101 = ? TT-205 = ? PSV-301 = ? LCV-402 = ? Answers: FIC-101 = Flow Indicating Controller (loop 101) TT-205 = Temperature Transmitter (loop 205) PSV-301 = Pressure Safety Valve (loop 301) LCV-402 = Level Control Valve (loop 402) 2.6 Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and Assembly (DFA) DFM and DFA are methodologies that consider manufacturing and assembly constraints during product design, reducing cost and improving quality. 2.6.1 DFM Principles Figure 2.4: DFM Guidelines Table 2.7: Design for Manufacturing Guidelines DFM Guideline Why It Matters Example Minimize total number of parts Fewer parts = fewer chances for failure, less inventory, lower cost Combine bracket and housing into single molded part Use standard components Standard parts are cheaper, faster to procure, easier to replace Use M6 bolts instead of custom fasteners Design for ease of fabrication Complex features increase manufacturing cost and defect rates Avoid undercuts, deep pockets, thin walls Design for ease of assembly Reduces assembly time and errors Use snap-fits instead of screws where appropriate Minimize assembly directions Multiple directions require repositioning, increasing time All parts insert from top-down in assembly Maximize compliance in assembly Tight tolerances increase cost; allow self-alignment where possible Use tapered holes for self-centering pins Design for ease of service Products will need maintenance; design for technician access Locate service points on accessible panels 2.6.2 DFA Analysis DFA systematically evaluates assembly operations to identify improvement opportunities. # DFA Analysis Example: Simple Assembly # Calculate assembly efficiency using Boothroyd-Dewhurst method # Assembly data (simplified) parts &lt;- data.frame( Part = c(&quot;Base&quot;, &quot;PCB&quot;, &quot;Cover&quot;, &quot;Screw 1&quot;, &quot;Screw 2&quot;, &quot;Screw 3&quot;, &quot;Screw 4&quot;, &quot;Label&quot;), Handling_Time = c(2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0), # seconds Insertion_Time = c(3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 2.0), # seconds Theoretically_Necessary = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE) ) # Calculations total_parts &lt;- nrow(parts) total_time &lt;- sum(parts$Handling_Time + parts$Insertion_Time) min_parts &lt;- sum(parts$Theoretically_Necessary) ideal_time &lt;- min_parts * 3 # 3 seconds is theoretical minimum per part efficiency &lt;- (ideal_time / total_time) * 100 cat(&quot;DFA Analysis Results:\\n&quot;) ## DFA Analysis Results: cat(&quot;=====================\\n&quot;) ## ===================== cat(sprintf(&quot;Total parts: %d\\n&quot;, total_parts)) ## Total parts: 8 cat(sprintf(&quot;Theoretically minimum parts: %d\\n&quot;, min_parts)) ## Theoretically minimum parts: 3 cat(sprintf(&quot;Total assembly time: %.1f seconds\\n&quot;, total_time)) ## Total assembly time: 62.5 seconds cat(sprintf(&quot;Ideal assembly time: %.1f seconds\\n&quot;, ideal_time)) ## Ideal assembly time: 9.0 seconds cat(sprintf(&quot;Design Efficiency: %.1f%%\\n&quot;, efficiency)) ## Design Efficiency: 14.4% cat(&quot;\\nOpportunity: Combine 4 screws into snap-fit design\\n&quot;) ## ## Opportunity: Combine 4 screws into snap-fit design Case Study: Redesigning for DFM/DFA Original Design: - 15 parts - 4 different screw types - Assembly time: 180 seconds - Multiple assembly directions - Special tools required Redesigned using DFM/DFA: - 8 parts (47% reduction) - 1 standard screw type - Assembly time: 75 seconds (58% reduction) - Single assembly direction (top-down) - No special tools Cost Impact: - Part cost reduced 35% - Assembly labor reduced 58% - Quality defects reduced 60% - Total product cost reduced 40% 2.7 HAZOP Studies HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study) is a systematic method to identify hazards and operability problems in process plants. 2.7.1 HAZOP Methodology Table 2.8: HAZOP Guide Words and Examples Guide Word Meaning Example with FLOW NO/NOT Complete negation of design intent No flow - pump failure, blocked line MORE Quantitative increase More flow - control valve fails open LESS Quantitative decrease Less flow - partial blockage, pump wear AS WELL AS Qualitative modification/addition Flow + contamination - upstream leak PART OF Qualitative decrease Only part of intended flow path active REVERSE Logical opposite of intent Reverse flow - check valve failure OTHER THAN Complete substitution Wrong material flowing 2.7.2 HAZOP Example Table 2.9: HAZOP Worksheet Example Node Parameter Guide Word Deviation Cause Consequence Safeguard Action Feed Pump P-101 to Reactor R-101 Flow No No Flow Pump failure, blocked suction Reactor starved, runaway possible Low flow alarm, interlock Verify interlock function Feed Pump P-101 to Reactor R-101 Flow More More Flow Control valve fails open Reactor overflow, environmental release High level alarm, overflow protection Add independent high-high level trip Feed Pump P-101 to Reactor R-101 Pressure More High Pressure Downstream blockage Pipe rupture, personnel injury Relief valve, high pressure trip Verify relief valve sizing Feed Pump P-101 to Reactor R-101 Temperature Less Low Temperature Cooling water leak into feed Reaction incomplete, off-spec product Low temp alarm, feed analysis Add temperature interlock Discussion: Why is HAZOP done during FEED, not later? HAZOP should be completed during FEED because: Cost of changes - Changes during FEED cost 1x; during detailed design cost 10x; during construction cost 100x Design influence - P&amp;IDs are still being developed and can be modified Equipment selection - Safety requirements may affect equipment sizing Budget accuracy - Safety systems must be included in project budget Regulatory approval - Many jurisdictions require HAZOP before construction permits Best practice: Conduct preliminary HAZOP early in FEED, then detailed HAZOP when P&amp;IDs are 60-80% complete. 2.8 Cost Estimation Accurate cost estimation is critical for project approval and budget management.

Environmental Control - Temperature: ±1°C throughout paint booth - Humidity: 65% ±5% RH - Air cleanliness: Class 10,000 2. Automation Requirements - 48 paint robots (8 per zone) - Conveyor system with 2m pitch - Zone tracking and recipe management 3. Safety Systems - Explosion-proof electrical classification - Fire suppression throughout - VOC monitoring and control 4. Quality Systems - Inline thickness measurement - Automated visual inspection - Recipe management and traceability Project Outcome: - On-time completion - Under budget by 3% - Quality metrics exceeded targets - 99.2% first-pass yield achieved 2.10 Review Questions Question 1: Automation Selection A medical device company needs to produce 5,000 units per year of a surgical instrument. The design is mature and not expected to change. Volumes could grow to 50,000 units if successful. Which automation type should they initially choose? Answer: Programmable automation (CNC machining, robotic cells) Reasoning: - Current volume (5,000/year) doesn’t justify fixed automation - Flexibility allows for minor design refinements - Can scale up by adding shifts or machines - Lower initial investment preserves capital - If volume grows to 50,000, can justify dedicated equipment later Question 2: P&amp;ID Interpretation Decode the following instrument tags and explain their function: FIC-201 PSV-305 TT-401 LCV-150 Answers: FIC-201 - Flow Indicating Controller (loop 201) Measures flow, displays value, and controls a valve PSV-305 - Pressure Safety Valve (loop 305) Relieves pressure if it exceeds setpoint (safety device) TT-401 - Temperature Transmitter (loop 401) Converts temperature measurement to 4-20mA signal LCV-150 - Level Control Valve (loop 150) Valve that is manipulated by a level controller Question 3: Project Phases Why is FEED often considered the most critical project phase? Answer: FEED is critical because: Defines scope - All subsequent work based on FEED deliverables Locks in 80% of cost - Design decisions determine equipment and construction costs Lowest cost to change - Changes cost 10-100x more in later phases Authorization basis - Management approves project based on FEED estimate Risk identification - HAZOP and risk studies identify safety requirements Contractor selection - FEED package used for competitive bidding Poor FEED = project overruns, scope changes, and budget problems. Question 4: DFM Application A product currently uses 12 screws of 3 different sizes for assembly. Apply DFM principles to improve this design. Answer: Apply these DFM principles: Minimize parts: Can some screws be eliminated by using integral snap-fits? Standardize: Use one screw size instead of three Reduces inventory complexity Single tool for assembly Lower procurement cost Design for ease: Consider alternatives: Snap-fit connections (no tools) Twist-lock features Press-fit pins Possible redesign: - Reduce from 12 screws to 4 screws (for serviceability) - All same size (M3 × 8) - Add 4 snap-fits for initial positioning - Result: 67% fewer fasteners, single tool, faster assembly Question 5: HAZOP Analysis For a reactor feed pump, apply the HAZOP guide word “REVERSE” to the parameter “FLOW”. What could cause this? What are the consequences? What safeguards would you recommend? Answer: Deviation: Reverse flow through feed pump Causes: - Pump stops while discharge valve open - Check valve fails (stuck open or missing) - Parallel pump creates backflow - Reactor pressure exceeds pump shutoff head Consequences: - Reactor contents backflow into feed tank - Contamination of feed material - Possible chemical reaction in feed system - Pump damage (running backward) Safeguards: - Check valve on pump discharge - Automatic pump discharge block valve (closes on pump stop) - Low flow alarm and trip - Reactor pressure monitoring - Backflow-preventing orifice 2.11 Summary Table 2.11: Chapter 2 Summary Topic Key Takeaway Automation Types Fixed for high volume single product; Programmable for batch; Flexible for variety with quick changeover Project Phases Concept → FEED → Detailed Design → Construction → Commissioning → Start-up PFDs vs P&amp;IDs PFD = big picture (equipment, flows); P&amp;ID = detailed (all instruments, valves, piping) DFM/DFA Design for easy manufacturing and assembly reduces cost 20-40% HAZOP Systematic hazard identification using guide words; do it during FEED Cost Estimation Estimate accuracy improves with engineering completion; AACE Class 1-5 2.11.1 Key Takeaways Automation selection depends on production volume, variety, and changeover requirements FEED phase defines 80% of project cost with only 10-15% of engineering effort P&amp;IDs are the critical document connecting design to construction DFM/DFA should be applied early in design to maximize impact HAZOP identifies hazards systematically and must be done before construction Cost estimates improve in accuracy as engineering progresses 2.12 References Towler, G., &amp; Sinnott, R.

Figure 3.2: Work Transport System Types What causes blocking and starving in production lines? Starving: A station is ready to work but has no parts to process. - Causes: Upstream station is slower, upstream breakdown, material shortage Blocking: A station finishes but cannot release the part. - Causes: Downstream station still working, downstream breakdown, no buffer space Solutions: 1. Buffers - Storage between stations absorbs variation 2. Line balancing - Equalize work content across stations 3. Parallel stations - Add capacity at bottlenecks 4.

Table 3.3: Key Manufacturing Time Metrics Metric Definition Formula Purpose Takt Time Available production time ÷ Customer demand \\(T_{takt} = \\frac{\\text{Available Time}}{\\text{Demand}}\\) Sets the pace of production to match demand Cycle Time Time between units coming off the line \\(T_c = \\frac{60}{R_p}\\) (min, if Rp in units/hr) Actual pace of the production line Lead Time Total time from order to delivery Order processing + Manufacturing + Delivery Customer’s wait time Throughput Time Time from raw material to finished goods Processing + Waiting + Moving + Inspection Internal manufacturing efficiency 3.4.1 Takt Time vs. Cycle Time # Takt Time Calculation Example # Automotive assembly plant # Given data shift_length_min &lt;- 480 # 8 hours = 480 minutes breaks_min &lt;- 30 # Two 15-minute breaks planned_downtime_min &lt;- 20 # Changeover, meetings customer_demand &lt;- 60 # Cars per shift # Calculate available time available_time &lt;- shift_length_min - breaks_min - planned_downtime_min cat(&quot;Available Production Time:&quot;, available_time, &quot;minutes per shift\\n&quot;) ## Available Production Time: 430 minutes per shift # Calculate Takt Time takt_time &lt;- available_time / customer_demand cat(&quot;Takt Time:&quot;, round(takt_time, 2), &quot;minutes per car\\n&quot;) ## Takt Time: 7.17 minutes per car cat(&quot; =&quot;, round(takt_time * 60, 1), &quot;seconds per car\\n\\n&quot;) ## = 430 seconds per car # Compare to actual cycle time actual_cycle_time &lt;- 7.5 # minutes (current performance) cat(&quot;Actual Cycle Time:&quot;, actual_cycle_time, &quot;minutes per car\\n&quot;) ## Actual Cycle Time: 7.5 minutes per car if (actual_cycle_time &lt;= takt_time) { cat(&quot;Status: MEETING DEMAND - Cycle time is within takt time\\n&quot;) cat(&quot;Capacity margin:&quot;, round((1 - actual_cycle_time/takt_time) * 100, 1), &quot;%\\n&quot;) } else { cat(&quot;Status: CANNOT MEET DEMAND - Cycle time exceeds takt time\\n&quot;) cat(&quot;Shortfall:&quot;, round((actual_cycle_time/takt_time - 1) * 100, 1), &quot;% over capacity\\n&quot;) } ## Status: CANNOT MEET DEMAND - Cycle time exceeds takt time ## Shortfall: 4.7 % over capacity Discussion: What happens when cycle time exceeds takt time? When Cycle Time &gt; Takt Time, you cannot meet customer demand. Options to fix this: Reduce cycle time: Kaizen improvements at bottleneck Better tools/fixtures Automation of slow tasks Increase available time: Add overtime Add shifts Reduce breaks (carefully!) Add capacity: Parallel stations at bottleneck Additional production lines Outsourcing Manage demand: Negotiate delivery schedules Build inventory in advance Redirect to other facilities Key insight: Takt time is the “heartbeat” of lean manufacturing - everything should be synchronized to it. 3.4.2 Manufacturing Cycle Time and Efficiency # Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT) and Efficiency (MCE) Example # Given production data production_time_min &lt;- 480 # Total time equipment ran units_produced &lt;- 60 # Good units produced # MCT Calculation MCT &lt;- production_time_min / units_produced cat(&quot;Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT):&quot;, MCT, &quot;minutes per unit\\n\\n&quot;) ## Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT): 8 minutes per unit # MCE Calculation requires understanding of value-added time # Typical breakdown of production time: value_added_time &lt;- 3.5 # Actual processing time (minutes) inspection_time &lt;- 0.5 # Quality checks wait_time &lt;- 2.5 # Queuing between operations move_time &lt;- 1.5 # Transport between stations total_time_per_unit &lt;- value_added_time + inspection_time + wait_time + move_time cat(&quot;Time breakdown per unit:\\n&quot;) ## Time breakdown per unit: cat(&quot; Value-added (processing):&quot;, value_added_time, &quot;min\\n&quot;) ## Value-added (processing): 3.5 min cat(&quot; Inspection:&quot;, inspection_time, &quot;min\\n&quot;) ## Inspection: 0.5 min cat(&quot; Waiting:&quot;, wait_time, &quot;min\\n&quot;) ## Waiting: 2.5 min cat(&quot; Moving:&quot;, move_time, &quot;min\\n&quot;) ## Moving: 1.5 min cat(&quot; Total:&quot;, total_time_per_unit, &quot;min\\n\\n&quot;) ## Total: 8 min # MCE Calculation MCE &lt;- (value_added_time / total_time_per_unit) * 100 cat(&quot;Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE):&quot;, round(MCE, 1), &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE): 43.8 % cat(&quot;\\nInterpretation: Only&quot;, round(MCE, 1), &quot;% of time adds value.\\n&quot;) ## ## Interpretation: Only 43.8 % of time adds value. cat(&quot;Opportunity:&quot;, round(100 - MCE, 1), &quot;% of time is waste that could be reduced.\\n&quot;) ## Opportunity: 56.2 % of time is waste that could be reduced. Figure 3.4: Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency - Where Does Time Go? 3.5 Manual Assembly Lines Manual assembly lines use human workers at each station. The efficiency depends on how well work is balanced across stations. 3.5.1 Line Balancing Line balancing assigns tasks to workstations to minimize idle time while meeting production rate requirements. Key formulas: \\[T_c = \\frac{\\text{Available Time}}{\\text{Required Output}} = \\frac{60}{R_p}\\] \\[TM = \\frac{\\sum t_i}{T_c} = \\frac{T_{wc}}{T_c}\\] \\[E_b = \\frac{T_{wc}}{n \\times T_c} \\times 100\\%\\] Where: - \\(T_c\\) = Cycle time (time available per unit) - \\(R_p\\) = Production rate (units per hour) - \\(TM\\) = Theoretical minimum stations - \\(T_{wc}\\) = Total work content (sum of all task times) - \\(n\\) = Actual number of stations - \\(E_b\\) = Line efficiency (balance efficiency) 3.5.2 Line Balancing Example: Electronics Assembly # Line Balancing Example: Tablet Computer Assembly # Task data tasks &lt;- data.frame( Task = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;), Description = c(&quot;Install battery&quot;, &quot;Mount display&quot;, &quot;Connect cables&quot;, &quot;Install motherboard&quot;, &quot;Add memory&quot;, &quot;Install camera&quot;, &quot;Attach case back&quot;, &quot;Final test&quot;), Time_sec = c(30, 45, 20, 55, 15, 25, 35, 40), Predecessors = c(&quot;-&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B,C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E,F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;) ) # Display task data cat(&quot;Assembly Tasks:\\n&quot;) ## Assembly Tasks: print(tasks[, c(&quot;Task&quot;, &quot;Description&quot;, &quot;Time_sec&quot;, &quot;Predecessors&quot;)]) ## Task Description Time_sec Predecessors ## 1 A Install battery 30 - ## 2 B Mount display 45 A ## 3 C Connect cables 20 A ## 4 D Install motherboard 55 B,C ## 5 E Add memory 15 D ## 6 F Install camera 25 D ## 7 G Attach case back 35 E,F ## 8 H Final test 40 G # Calculate metrics total_work_content &lt;- sum(tasks$Time_sec) cat(&quot;\\nTotal Work Content:&quot;, total_work_content, &quot;seconds\\n&quot;) ## ## Total Work Content: 265 seconds # Production requirements desired_output &lt;- 45 # units per hour available_time &lt;- 3600 # seconds per hour # Step 1: Calculate cycle time cycle_time &lt;- available_time / desired_output cat(&quot;\\nStep 1 - Cycle Time:&quot;) ## ## Step 1 - Cycle Time: cat(&quot;\\n Required output:&quot;, desired_output, &quot;units/hour&quot;) ## ## Required output: 45 units/hour cat(&quot;\\n Cycle time = 3600 /&quot;, desired_output, &quot;=&quot;, cycle_time, &quot;seconds\\n&quot;) ## ## Cycle time = 3600 / 45 = 80 seconds # Step 2: Calculate theoretical minimum stations TM &lt;- total_work_content / cycle_time cat(&quot;\\nStep 2 - Theoretical Minimum Stations:&quot;) ## ## Step 2 - Theoretical Minimum Stations: cat(&quot;\\n TM =&quot;, total_work_content, &quot;/&quot;, cycle_time, &quot;=&quot;, round(TM, 2)) ## ## TM = 265 / 80 = 3.31 cat(&quot;\\n Minimum stations required:&quot;, ceiling(TM), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## ## Minimum stations required: 4 # Step 3: Assign tasks to stations (using largest task time rule) cat(&quot;\\nStep 3 - Station Assignments (respecting precedence):\\n&quot;) ## ## Step 3 - Station Assignments (respecting precedence): cat(&quot; Station 1: A (30s) + C (20s) + B (45s) = 95s &gt; 80s...

Figure 3.5: Precedence Diagram for Tablet Assembly Try It: Can you find a better balance? Challenge: Reassign tasks to improve efficiency above 80%. Hints: - Can task A be split into two smaller tasks? - Could parallel workstations handle the bottleneck task D? - What if we allow 85 seconds per station (slower line, fewer stations)? One solution with parallel stations: - Station 1: A + C = 50s - Station 2a: B = 45s (parallel) - Station 2b: B = 45s (parallel) - Station 3: D = 55s - Station 4: E + F = 40s - Station 5: G + H = 75s With parallelism at Station 2, effective cycle time stays at 55s (Station 3 bottleneck), but we can now achieve higher throughput. 3.6 Automated Production Lines Automated lines reduce human intervention using mechanized transfer systems and automated workstations. They’re used for high-volume production with well-defined work content. 3.6.1 Impact of Station Failures The performance of automated lines is degraded by station failures. Even small failure probabilities can significantly reduce output. Actual Cycle Time: \\[T_p = T_c + pT\\] Actual Production Rate: \\[R_p = \\frac{60}{T_p} = \\frac{60}{T_c + pT}\\] Where: - \\(T_c\\) = Ideal cycle time (minutes) - \\(p\\) = Probability of station failure per cycle - \\(T\\) = Average downtime per failure (minutes) # Automated Line Performance Analysis # Line parameters ideal_cycle_time &lt;- 1.0 # minutes per part (ideal) n_stations &lt;- 10 # Number of stations # Scenario comparison scenarios &lt;- data.frame( Scenario = c(&quot;World Class&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Average&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;), Failure_Prob = c(0.005, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10), # Per station per cycle Repair_Time = c(2, 5, 10, 15) # Minutes average ) # Calculate line performance for each scenario cat(&quot;Automated Line Performance Analysis\\n&quot;) ## Automated Line Performance Analysis cat(&quot;===================================\\n&quot;) ## =================================== cat(&quot;Ideal cycle time:&quot;, ideal_cycle_time, &quot;min/part\\n&quot;) ## Ideal cycle time: 1 min/part cat(&quot;Number of stations:&quot;, n_stations, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Number of stations: 10 cat(&quot;Ideal production rate:&quot;, 60/ideal_cycle_time, &quot;parts/hour\\n\\n&quot;) ## Ideal production rate: 60 parts/hour for(i in 1:nrow(scenarios)) { p &lt;- scenarios$Failure_Prob[i] T &lt;- scenarios$Repair_Time[i] # Line failure probability (any station) p_line &lt;- 1 - (1 - p)^n_stations # Actual cycle time Tp &lt;- ideal_cycle_time + p_line * T # Actual production rate Rp &lt;- 60 / Tp # Efficiency efficiency &lt;- (ideal_cycle_time / Tp) * 100 cat(sprintf(&quot;%s Performance:\\n&quot;, scenarios$Scenario[i])) cat(sprintf(&quot; Station failure prob: %.1f%%\\n&quot;, p * 100)) cat(sprintf(&quot; Line failure prob: %.1f%%\\n&quot;, p_line * 100)) cat(sprintf(&quot; Average repair time: %d min\\n&quot;, T)) cat(sprintf(&quot; Actual cycle time: %.2f min\\n&quot;, Tp)) cat(sprintf(&quot; Actual production: %.1f parts/hour\\n&quot;, Rp)) cat(sprintf(&quot; Line efficiency: %.1f%%\\n\\n&quot;, efficiency)) } ## World Class Performance: ## Station failure prob: 0.5% ## Line failure prob: 4.9% ## Average repair time: 2 min ## Actual cycle time: 1.10 min ## Actual production: 54.7 parts/hour ## Line efficiency: 91.1% ## ## Good Performance: ## Station failure prob: 2.0% ## Line failure prob: 18.3% ## Average repair time: 5 min ## Actual cycle time: 1.91 min ## Actual production: 31.3 parts/hour ## Line efficiency: 52.2% ## ## Average Performance: ## Station failure prob: 5.0% ## Line failure prob: 40.1% ## Average repair time: 10 min ## Actual cycle time: 5.01 min ## Actual production: 12.0 parts/hour ## Line efficiency: 19.9% ## ## Poor Performance: ## Station failure prob: 10.0% ## Line failure prob: 65.1% ## Average repair time: 15 min ## Actual cycle time: 10.77 min ## Actual production: 5.6 parts/hour ## Line efficiency: 9.3% Figure 3.6: Impact of Station Failures on Production Rate Discussion: Why is preventive maintenance critical for automated lines? The math shows why: - At 5% failure probability with 10-minute repairs, you lose 25% of capacity - This costs more than the maintenance to prevent it Cost comparison (example): - Lost production: 15 parts/hour × $50/part × 8 hours = $6,000/day - Preventive maintenance: $500/day - ROI of PM: 12:1 Best practices: 1. Track failure data by station 2. Prioritize PM on high-failure stations 3. Stock critical spare parts 4. Train operators on quick changeover/repair 5. Consider redundant stations for bottlenecks 3.6.2 Buffer Sizing Buffers between stations decouple operations and improve overall line availability. Figure 3.7: Effect of Buffers on Line Availability 3.7 Cellular Manufacturing Cellular manufacturing applies Group Technology to organize production into cells that specialize in “families” of similar parts. 3.7.1 Part Families and Machine Cells Figure 3.8: Cellular Manufacturing: From Process Layout to Cells Table 3.4: Cellular Manufacturing Benefits vs. Traditional Process Layout Metric Traditional (Process) Cellular Typical Improvement Setup time High - frequent changeovers Low - dedicated to family 50-90% reduction Work-in-process High - batches waiting Low - continuous flow 50-90% reduction Lead time Long - complex routing Short - U-cell flow 50-80% reduction Quality defects Higher - multiple handoffs Lower - cell ownership 30-50% reduction Material handling High - long distances Low - within cell 40-70% reduction Floor space More - large aisles Less - compact cells 20-50% reduction Worker skills Specialized by machine Cross-trained on cell Increased flexibility 3.8 Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) An FMS is a highly automated cell consisting of CNC machines interconnected by automated material handling, all controlled by a central computer. 3.8.1 FMS Components ## Warning in geom_segment(aes(x = 4, xend = 2.5, y = 2.4, yend = 2.3), linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;): All aesthetics have length 1, but ## the data has 6 rows. ## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` ## or provide this layer with data ## containing a single row. ## Warning in geom_segment(aes(x = 4, xend = 4, y = 2.4, yend = 2.6), linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;): All aesthetics have length 1, but ## the data has 6 rows. ## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` ## or provide this layer with data ## containing a single row. ## Warning in geom_segment(aes(x = 4, xend = 5.5, y = 2.4, yend = 2.3), linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;): All aesthetics have length 1, but ## the data has 6 rows. ## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` ## or provide this layer with data ## containing a single row. ## Warning in geom_segment(aes(x = 4, xend = 4, y = 1.6, yend = 1.4), linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;): All aesthetics have length 1, but ## the data has 6 rows. ## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` ## or provide this layer with data ## containing a single row.

Table 3.6: SMED Methodology for Setup Reduction Step Description Examples Typical Improvement Separate Distinguish internal setup (machine stopped) from external setup (machine running) Pre-stage tools while machine runs; Pre-heat molds; Prepare fixtures 30-50% reduction Convert Convert as much internal setup to external setup as possible Use quick-release clamps instead of bolts; Standardize tool heights Additional 20-30% Streamline Reduce time for remaining internal and external activities Eliminate adjustments; Use one-turn fasteners; Parallel operations with 2 people Additional 10-20% Case Study: Injection Molding Changeover Before SMED: - Changeover time: 90 minutes - Machine stopped for entire process - One operator working alone After SMED analysis: Activity Before Type After Change Find tools 10 min Internal 0 External - tools pre-staged Remove old mold 15 min Internal 5 min Quick-release clamps Get new mold 10 min Internal 0 External - mold pre-staged at machine Install new mold 20 min Internal 8 min Standardized mold heights Connect utilities 10 min Internal 4 min Quick-connect fittings Adjust settings 15 min Internal 3 min Pre-programmed recipes First article 10 min Internal 5 min Improved documentation Results: - Total changeover: 25 minutes (72% reduction) - Additional capacity: +15 changeovers/week possible - Smaller batch sizes now economical 3.9.2 AGV and AMR Systems Table 3.7: AGV vs. AMR Comparison Feature AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot) Navigation Fixed path (wires, magnets, tape) Dynamic (SLAM, vision, sensors) Flexibility Low - follows predetermined routes High - calculates optimal routes Infrastructure Requires installation (floor modifications) Minimal (maps environment) Cost Lower vehicle cost, higher infrastructure Higher vehicle cost, lower infrastructure Path Changes Requires physical modification Software update only Obstacle Handling Stops and waits Navigates around obstacles Best Application High-volume, repetitive routes Variable routes, dynamic environments 3.9.3 Digital Twin A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical manufacturing system that is updated in real-time with sensor data. Figure 3.10: Digital Twin Concept Digital Twin Applications: - Predictive maintenance (predict failures before they occur) - Process optimization (simulate changes before implementation) - Training (virtual commissioning and operator training) - Quality prediction (correlate parameters with outcomes) 3.10 Industry Applications Table 3.8: Manufacturing System Applications by Industry System Type Automotive Food Processing Aerospace/Defense Transfer Line Engine block machining, cylinder head lines Beverage bottling, canning lines High-volume fastener production Manual Assembly Final vehicle assembly, interior trim Packaging, quality inspection Aircraft final assembly, inspection FMS Transmission components, brake parts Multi-product bakery equipment Structural component machining Cellular Subassemblies, wiring harnesses Specialty product lines Avionics assembly, repair cells AGV/AMR Body shop material delivery, parts sequencing Ingredient delivery, packaging transport Large assembly transport, tool delivery 3.11 Review Questions Question 1: Takt Time Calculation A plant operates 8-hour shifts with 30 minutes of breaks. Daily demand is 400 units. Calculate the takt time. Solution: Available time = 8 hours × 60 min - 30 min = 450 minutes Takt time = 450 min / 400 units = 1.125 minutes per unit = 67.5 seconds If actual cycle time is 60 seconds, the plant has (67.5 - 60)/67.5 = 11% capacity margin. Question 2: Line Efficiency A 6-station assembly line has a cycle time of 2 minutes. The task times at each station are: 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 1.7, 1.6, and 1.5 minutes. Calculate the line efficiency. Solution: Total work content = 1.8 + 1.9 + 2.0 + 1.7 + 1.6 + 1.5 = 10.5 minutes Line efficiency = (10.5) / (6 × 2.0) × 100% = 10.5/12 × 100% = 87.5% Balance delay (idle time) = 100% - 87.5% = 12.5% Question 3: Downtime Impact An automated line has 8 stations, each with 3% failure probability per cycle and 8-minute average repair time. The ideal cycle time is 0.5 minutes. What is the actual production rate? Solution: Line failure probability = 1 - (1 - 0.03)^8 = 1 - 0.97^8 = 1 - 0.784 = 21.6% Actual cycle time = 0.5 + (0.216 × 8) = 0.5 + 1.73 = 2.23 minutes Actual production rate = 60 / 2.23 = 26.9 parts/hour (vs. ideal of 120 parts/hour - only 22% of ideal capacity!) This shows why reliability is critical in automated systems. Question 4: FMS Selection A company makes 15 different part numbers with annual volumes of 500-5,000 each. Parts are machined from aluminum and require milling, drilling, and tapping. Which system is most appropriate: dedicated transfer line, FMS, or CNC job shop? Answer: FMS is most appropriate because: Volume range (500-5,000) is ideal for FMS Part variety (15 types) requires flexibility Similar operations (milling, drilling, tapping) can share equipment Material (aluminum) machines well on CNC Transfer line would require too much volume per part. Job shop would have high setup times and low efficiency for these volumes. Question 5: SMED Application A stamping press has a 45-minute die change. Internal activities are 35 minutes, external are 10 minutes but currently done with machine stopped. How much can SMED reduce this? Answer: Step 1 - Separate: Do the 10 minutes of external work while press runs. - New changeover: 35 minutes (30% reduction) Step 2 - Convert: Analyze the 35 minutes: - If 15 minutes can be converted to external (pre-staging, etc.): New changeover = 20 minutes Step 3 - Streamline: Quick-release clamps, standardization might save another 5 minutes. - Final changeover: 15 minutes (67% reduction) This enables smaller batch sizes and more frequent changeovers. 3.12 Summary Table 3.9: Chapter 3 Summary Topic Key Points Production Lines Manual, continuous, synchronous, or asynchronous transfer; each has trade-offs Time Metrics Takt time = demand pace; Cycle time = actual pace; MCE measures value-added % Line Balancing Assign tasks to minimize idle time; Efficiency = work content / (stations × cycle time) Automated Lines Reliability is critical; Small failure probabilities cause large capacity losses Cellular Manufacturing Group Technology groups part families; Reduces setup, WIP, lead time 50-90% FMS Automated cells for medium variety/volume; Computer-controlled flexibility Modern Concepts SMED for quick changeover; AGV/AMR for material handling; Digital twins for optimization 3.12.1 Key Takeaways Match system to product - Volume and variety determine optimal manufacturing system Takt time sets the pace - Everything should be designed to meet customer demand rate Balance matters - Unbalanced lines waste capacity through idle time Reliability is critical - Small failures compound to large losses in automated systems Flexibility has value - FMS and cellular systems enable quick response to change Technology evolves - Digital twins and AMRs are transforming manufacturing 3.13 References Groover, M.P.

Figure 4.2: Example Process Layout - Machine Shop 4.3.1 Characteristics of Process Layouts Table 4.2: Process Layout Characteristics Characteristic Description Equipment General-purpose machines Labor Skilled workers required Flexibility High - can handle variety Processing Speed Slower due to varied routing Material Handling Higher costs (complex paths) Scheduling Complex - different routes Space Requirements Higher - WIP inventory storage Discussion Question: Can you identify a process layout in your daily life? Think about: - A hospital emergency room (patients routed based on their needs) - A university campus (students move between buildings for different classes) - A grocery store (customers choose their own path) - A machine shop (parts routed based on required operations) What makes these process layouts? Similar functions are grouped together, and “products” (patients, students, customers) follow different paths based on their individual needs. 4.3.2 Real-World Examples 4.4 Product Layout (Assembly Line) In a product layout, equipment and workstations are arranged in a line according to the sequence of operations needed to produce the product. Every unit follows the same path. Figure 4.3: Product Layout - Assembly Line 4.4.1 Characteristics of Product Layouts Table 4.3: Product Layout: Advantages vs. Disadvantages Advantage Disadvantage High production rate High initial investment Low unit cost Low flexibility Low material handling Line stops affect all Simple scheduling Monotonous work Less WIP inventory Requires balanced workloads Quick Quiz: Product Layout Question: A car wash where vehicles move through a series of cleaning stations is an example of which layout type? Answer: Product Layout - all cars follow the same path through the same sequence of operations. 4.5 Hybrid Layout (Cellular Manufacturing) Hybrid layouts combine the flexibility of process layouts with the efficiency of product layouts. The most common type is the cellular layout using Group Technology. 4.5.1 Group Technology Concept Group Technology (GT) identifies parts with similar characteristics and groups them into part families. Machines are then arranged into cells to process these families. Figure 4.4: Cellular Layout with Manufacturing Cells Discussion Question: Benefits of Cellular Manufacturing What are the main benefits of cellular manufacturing over traditional process layouts? Reduced material handling - Parts stay within the cell Shorter lead times - No waiting between departments Less WIP inventory - Smaller batches, faster flow Improved quality - Workers responsible for complete part Team accountability - Cell teams own their output 4.6 Fixed-Position Layout In a fixed-position layout, the product remains stationary while workers, equipment, and materials are brought to it. This is used when the product is too large or heavy to move. 4.6.1 Examples of Fixed-Position Layouts Shipbuilding - Ships built in dry docks Aircraft manufacturing - Large aircraft assembled in hangars Construction - Buildings, bridges, dams Surgery - Patient remains stationary Challenge Question: Managing a Fixed-Position Layout What are the unique challenges of managing a fixed-position layout? Think about: - Scheduling deliveries of materials and equipment - Coordinating multiple contractors/teams - Limited space around the product - Weather and environmental factors (outdoor projects) - Ensuring safety with many workers in one area 4.7 Designing Process Layouts Designing an effective process layout involves three main steps: 4.7.1 Step 1: Gather Information You need to determine: - Space requirements for each department - Available space in the facility - Closeness relationships between departments 4.7.1.1 From-To Matrix (Load Matrix) A From-To matrix shows the number of trips or loads between departments: Table 4.4: From-To Matrix: Loads per Day Between Departments Receiving Machining Assembly Painting Shipping Receiving 100 50 0 0 Machining 0 200 50 0 Assembly 0 0 100 60 Painting 0 0 0 150 Shipping 0 0 0 0 4.7.2 Step 2: Develop Block Plans Use the Load-Distance Model to evaluate layout alternatives: \\[\\text{Total Cost} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} L_{ij} \\times D_{ij} \\times C\\] Where: - \\(L_{ij}\\) = Number of loads between departments \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) - \\(D_{ij}\\) = Distance between departments \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) - \\(C\\) = Cost per unit distance 4.7.3 Interactive Example: Comparing Two Layouts Figure 4.5: Comparing Two Process Layout Alternatives # Calculate Load-Distance scores for both layouts # From-To data: Receiving-&gt;Machining=100, Machining-&gt;Assembly=200, # Assembly-&gt;Painting=100, Painting-&gt;Shipping=150 # Layout A distances (linear): all adjacent = 1 unit layout_A_score &lt;- 100*1 + 200*1 + 100*1 + 150*1 cat(&quot;Layout A Total Load-Distance:&quot;, layout_A_score, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Layout A Total Load-Distance: 550 # Layout B distances (compact): most departments closer together # Receiving to Machining = 1.12 (diagonal) # Machining to Assembly = 1 # Assembly to Painting = 1.12 (diagonal) # Painting to Shipping = 1 layout_B_score &lt;- 100*1.12 + 200*1 + 100*1.12 + 150*1 cat(&quot;Layout B Total Load-Distance:&quot;, round(layout_B_score, 1), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Layout B Total Load-Distance: 574 cat(&quot;\\nLayout A is better by:&quot;, round(layout_B_score - layout_A_score, 1), &quot;units&quot;) ## ## Layout A is better by: 24 units Why does the linear layout win in this case? In this example, the linear layout (A) wins because the process flow is essentially sequential (Receiving → Machining → Assembly → Painting → Shipping). When flow is sequential, a product layout (linear arrangement) is more efficient. Process layouts are better when there’s varied routing between departments. 4.7.4 Step 3: Develop Detailed Layout Once the block plan is selected: - Determine exact sizes and shapes of departments - Plan aisle locations and widths - Consider utilities, safety exits, and accessibility - Use CAD software or 3D modeling for visualization 4.8 Designing Product Layouts (Line Balancing) The key challenge in product layout design is line balancing - assigning tasks to workstations to minimize idle time while meeting production requirements. 4.8.1 Line Balancing Steps Identify tasks and precedence relationships Calculate required cycle time Calculate theoretical minimum number of stations Assign tasks to stations Calculate efficiency 4.8.2 Key Formulas Cycle Time: \\[C = \\frac{\\text{Available Production Time}}{\\text{Desired Output}}\\] Theoretical Minimum Stations: \\[TM = \\frac{\\sum t_i}{C}\\] Line Efficiency: \\[\\text{Efficiency} = \\frac{\\sum t_i}{n \\times C} \\times 100\\%\\] Where: - \\(C\\) = Cycle time - \\(\\sum t_i\\) = Total task time - \\(n\\) = Number of workstations 4.8.3 Interactive Example: Pizza Assembly Line Table 4.5: Pizza Assembly Tasks Task Description Time (sec) Predecessors A Roll dough 40 B Spread sauce 25 A C Add cheese 20 B D Add toppings 35 B E Season 15 C, D F Box pizza 30 E Figure 4.6: Precedence Diagram for Pizza Assembly 4.8.4 Line Balancing Calculation # Given data total_task_time &lt;- 40 + 25 + 20 + 35 + 15 + 30 # seconds desired_output &lt;- 60 # pizzas per hour available_time &lt;- 3600 # seconds per hour # Step 1: Calculate Cycle Time cycle_time &lt;- available_time / desired_output cat(&quot;Cycle Time:&quot;, cycle_time, &quot;seconds per pizza\\n&quot;) ## Cycle Time: 60 seconds per pizza # Step 2: Calculate Theoretical Minimum Stations TM &lt;- total_task_time / cycle_time cat(&quot;Theoretical Minimum Stations:&quot;, TM, &quot;=&quot;, ceiling(TM), &quot;stations\\n&quot;) ## Theoretical Minimum Stations: 2.75 = 3 stations # Step 3: Assign tasks to stations (one possible solution) cat(&quot;\\n--- Workstation Assignments ---\\n&quot;) ## ## --- Workstation Assignments --- cat(&quot;Station 1: A (40s) + B (25s) = 65s &gt; 60s ... EXCEEDS!\\n&quot;) ## Station 1: A (40s) + B (25s) = 65s &gt; 60s ... EXCEEDS! cat(&quot;Let&#39;s try again:\\n&quot;) ## Let&#39;s try again: cat(&quot;Station 1: A (40s) = 40s [Idle: 20s]\\n&quot;) ## Station 1: A (40s) = 40s [Idle: 20s] cat(&quot;Station 2: B (25s) + D (35s) = 60s [Idle: 0s]\\n&quot;) ## Station 2: B (25s) + D (35s) = 60s [Idle: 0s] cat(&quot;Station 3: C (20s) + E (15s) + F (30s) = 65s &gt; 60s... EXCEEDS!\\n&quot;) ## Station 3: C (20s) + E (15s) + F (30s) = 65s &gt; 60s... EXCEEDS! cat(&quot;Revised:\\n&quot;) ## Revised: cat(&quot;Station 3: C (20s) + E (15s) = 35s [Idle: 25s]\\n&quot;) ## Station 3: C (20s) + E (15s) = 35s [Idle: 25s] cat(&quot;Station 4: F (30s) = 30s [Idle: 30s]\\n&quot;) ## Station 4: F (30s) = 30s [Idle: 30s] # With 4 stations n_stations &lt;- 4 efficiency &lt;- (total_task_time / (n_stations * cycle_time)) * 100 cat(&quot;\\n--- Results ---\\n&quot;) ## ## --- Results --- cat(&quot;Number of Stations:&quot;, n_stations, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Number of Stations: 4 cat(&quot;Line Efficiency:&quot;, round(efficiency, 1), &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Line Efficiency: 68.8 % cat(&quot;Balance Delay (Idle Time):&quot;, round(100 - efficiency, 1), &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Balance Delay (Idle Time): 31.2 % Try It Yourself: Can you find a better balance? Challenge: Can you assign tasks to only 3 stations while respecting the precedence constraints? Hint: Consider these assignments: - Station 1: A (40s) + ? - Station 2: B (25s) + ? + ? - Station 3: ? + ? Remember: Total time per station cannot exceed 60 seconds! Solution: It’s actually possible with careful planning: - Station 1: A (40s) = 40s - Station 2: B (25s) + C (20s) + E (15s) = 60s (but E needs C AND D complete!) So 3 stations is NOT feasible due to precedence constraints. The minimum is 4 stations for this problem. 4.9 Warehouse Layout Design Warehouse layouts are a special case of process layouts focused on minimizing material handling. 4.9.1 Key Principles Place high-volume items near the dock Group items that are often picked together Use ABC analysis for storage assignment: A items (20% of SKUs, 80% of picks): Prime locations B items (30% of SKUs, 15% of picks): Secondary locations C items (50% of SKUs, 5% of picks): Remote locations Figure 4.7: Warehouse Layout: ABC Storage Strategy 4.10 Office Layout Design Office layouts balance communication needs with privacy requirements. 4.10.1 Two Main Approaches Table 4.6: Office Layout Comparison Aspect Open Plan Traditional/Closed Space Shared workspaces Private offices Walls Partitions/dividers Permanent walls Flexibility High - easy to reconfigure Low - expensive to change Communication Excellent Limited Privacy Low High Cost Lower Higher 4.10.2 Office Ergonomics Checklist Click to expand: Office Ergonomics Best Practices Posture: - Support the small of the back - Keep shoulders relaxed - Maintain neutral wrist position - Feet flat on floor or footrest Lighting: - Position monitor to reduce glare - Adjust brightness for screen vs. paper work - Use task lighting when needed Workstation: - Monitor at arm’s length - Top of screen at or below eye level - Keyboard and mouse at elbow height Work Habits: - Take breaks every 30-60 minutes - Vary tasks to prevent repetitive strain - Use keyboard shortcuts to reduce mouse use 4.10.3 The Future of Office Design 4.11 Summary: Choosing the Right Layout Figure 4.8: Layout Selection Decision Guide 4.11.1 Key Takeaways Process layouts offer flexibility for varied products but have higher material handling costs Product layouts are efficient for high-volume, standardized products Cellular layouts provide a middle ground with benefits of both Fixed-position layouts are necessary when products cannot be moved Line balancing is critical for efficient product layouts Warehouse layouts should minimize travel distance for high-frequency items 4.12 Industry Case Studies 4.12.1 Case Study 1: Food Processing Plant Layout Food processing facilities have unique layout requirements due to food safety, hygiene, and regulatory compliance. Figure 4.9: Food Processing Plant Layout Example Key Design Principles for Food Processing: Table 4.7: Food Processing Layout Design Principles Principle Description Regulatory Reference Linear Flow Raw materials → Processing → Packaging (no backtracking) FSMA Zone Separation Physical barriers between raw and ready-to-eat areas HACCP Cleanability Smooth, non-porous surfaces; rounded corners; proper drainage 3-A Standards Temperature Control Maintain cold chain; separate refrigerated zones FDA 21 CFR 110 Sanitary Design Handwashing stations, foot baths, air curtains at zone transitions USDA FSIS Allergen Control Dedicated lines or thorough cleaning between allergen products FALCPA Discussion Question: Cross-Contamination Prevention Question: A food processing plant produces both peanut butter products and tree nut-free products. What layout considerations are essential? Key Considerations: Physical Separation: Completely separate production lines with physical barriers (walls, not just distance) Air Handling: Separate HVAC systems to prevent airborne allergen transfer Personnel Flow: Dedicated workers for each line, or strict gowning/cleaning procedures when crossing zones Scheduling: If shared equipment is unavoidable, schedule allergen products last before deep cleaning Traffic Patterns: Forklift and cart paths should not cross between allergen zones Verification: Air sampling and surface swabs to verify effectiveness 4.12.2 Case Study 2: Aerospace Manufacturing Facility Aerospace facilities often use fixed-position layouts combined with process layouts for component fabrication. Figure 4.10: Aerospace Assembly Facility Layout Aerospace Layout Characteristics: Clean rooms for precision components (hydraulics, avionics) High-bay areas for large assembly operations Overhead cranes for moving heavy components Flow-line final assembly (aircraft moves through stations) for high-volume commercial aircraft Fixed-position for military aircraft or low-volume production Strict FOD (Foreign Object Debris) control throughout Video: Boeing 737 Assembly Watch how Boeing uses a moving assembly line for high-volume aircraft production: 4.12.3 Case Study 3: Automotive Supplier - Hybrid Cell Layout Figure 4.11: Automotive Supplier Facility with Cellular Layout JIT Delivery Requirements: Automotive suppliers must often deliver directly to the assembly line in sequence (JIS - Just-In-Sequence): Table 4.8: JIT/JIS Requirements and Layout Implications Requirement Typical Standard Layout Impact Delivery Window ±30 minutes of scheduled time Dedicated shipping lane, staging area near dock Sequence Accuracy 100% (0 sequence errors) Pick-to-light systems, visual management Quality Level 0 PPM target (Six Sigma) Inline inspection, mistake-proofing (poka-yoke) Packaging Returnable containers to line side Container cleaning/storage area needed Traceability Full lot/serial traceability required Barcode/RFID scanning stations throughout 4.13 Ergonomics in Manufacturing Ergonomics (human factors engineering) is critical for plant layout design to ensure worker safety, reduce injuries, and improve productivity. 4.13.1 The NIOSH Lifting Equation The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed an equation to evaluate manual lifting tasks: \\[RWL = LC \\times HM \\times VM \\times DM \\times AM \\times FM \\times CM\\] Where RWL = Recommended Weight Limit (in pounds or kg) Table 4.9: NIOSH Lifting Equation Factors Factor Name Formula Description LC Load Constant 51 lb (23 kg) Maximum weight under ideal conditions HM Horizontal Multiplier 10/H H = horizontal distance from spine to load (inches) VM Vertical Multiplier 1 - 0.0075|V - 30| V = vertical height of hands at start (inches) DM Distance Multiplier 0.82 + 1.8/D D = vertical travel distance (inches) AM Asymmetric Multiplier 1 - 0.0032A A = angle of asymmetry (degrees) FM Frequency Multiplier Table lookup Based on lift frequency and duration CM Coupling Multiplier Table lookup Based on grip quality (good/fair/poor) 4.13.2 Lifting Index Calculation \\[LI = \\frac{\\text{Actual Weight}}{\\text{RWL}}\\] Table 4.10: Lifting Index Interpretation Lifting Index Risk Level Action Required LI ≤ 1.0 Low Task is acceptable for most workers 1.0 &lt; LI ≤ 3.0 Moderate Task poses risk; engineering controls recommended LI &gt; 3.0 High Task is unacceptable; immediate redesign required 4.13.3 NIOSH Lifting Example # Example: Worker lifts 35 lb boxes from pallet to conveyor # Conditions: # - Horizontal distance (H) = 15 inches # - Vertical height at start (V) = 10 inches # - Vertical travel distance (D) = 20 inches # - Asymmetry angle (A) = 30 degrees # - Frequency = 4 lifts per minute, 2 hours # - Coupling = Fair (handles present) LC &lt;- 51 # Load constant (lb) # Calculate multipliers HM &lt;- 10 / 15 # Horizontal multiplier VM &lt;- 1 - 0.0075 * abs(10 - 30) # Vertical multiplier DM &lt;- 0.82 + (1.8 / 20) # Distance multiplier AM &lt;- 1 - 0.0032 * 30 # Asymmetric multiplier FM &lt;- 0.72 # From NIOSH table: 4 lifts/min, 1-2 hours CM &lt;- 0.95 # Fair coupling cat(&quot;Multiplier Values:\\n&quot;) ## Multiplier Values: cat(&quot; HM (Horizontal):&quot;, round(HM, 3), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## HM (Horizontal): 0.667 cat(&quot; VM (Vertical):&quot;, round(VM, 3), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## VM (Vertical): 0.85 cat(&quot; DM (Distance):&quot;, round(DM, 3), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## DM (Distance): 0.91 cat(&quot; AM (Asymmetry):&quot;, round(AM, 3), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## AM (Asymmetry): 0.904 cat(&quot; FM (Frequency):&quot;, FM, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## FM (Frequency): 0.72 cat(&quot; CM (Coupling):&quot;, CM, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## CM (Coupling): 0.95 # Calculate RWL RWL &lt;- LC * HM * VM * DM * AM * FM * CM cat(&quot;\\nRecommended Weight Limit (RWL):&quot;, round(RWL, 1), &quot;lb\\n&quot;) ## ## Recommended Weight Limit (RWL): 16.3 lb # Calculate Lifting Index actual_weight &lt;- 35 LI &lt;- actual_weight / RWL cat(&quot;Lifting Index (LI):&quot;, round(LI, 2), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Lifting Index (LI): 2.15 if (LI &lt;= 1.0) { cat(&quot;\\nRisk Level: LOW - Task is acceptable\\n&quot;) } else if (LI &lt;= 3.0) { cat(&quot;\\nRisk Level: MODERATE - Consider engineering controls\\n&quot;) } else { cat(&quot;\\nRisk Level: HIGH - Immediate redesign required\\n&quot;) } ## ## Risk Level: MODERATE - Consider engineering controls Discussion Question: Reducing the Lifting Index Based on the example above, what layout or workstation changes could reduce the Lifting Index? Solutions (in order of effectiveness): Reduce horizontal distance (H): Move conveyor closer to pallet position If H = 10”: HM improves from 0.67 to 1.0 → RWL increases by 50% Raise the starting height (V): Use elevated pallet positions or pallet lifters If V = 30” (optimal): VM improves from 0.85 to 1.0 → RWL increases by 18% Eliminate asymmetry (A): Reposition conveyor directly in front of pallet If A = 0°: AM improves from 0.90 to 1.0 → RWL increases by 11% Reduce frequency: Add a second worker or use automation If 1 lift/min: FM improves from 0.72 to 0.94 → RWL increases by 31% Improve coupling: Use boxes with good handles If good coupling: CM improves from 0.95 to 1.0 → RWL increases by 5% Best solution: Implement a scissor lift for the pallet (adjustable height) and move the conveyor closer. This addresses the largest multiplier reductions. 4.13.4 Ergonomic Workstation Design Figure 4.12: Ergonomic Work Zones for Standing Operations Layout Implications: Primary zone: Most frequently used tools and parts Secondary zone: Regularly used items, occasional reaches Tertiary zone: Rarely needed items, should trigger redesign if frequent use required 4.14 Modern Layout Trends and Industry 4.0 4.14.1 Flexible Manufacturing Layouts Modern facilities must adapt quickly to changing product demands. Key trends include: Table 4.11: Modern Flexible Layout Trends Trend Description Benefits Modular Workstations Pre-built workstation modules that can be relocated in hours Rapid response to volume changes, easy expansion Reconfigurable Cells Cells with standardized machine interfaces for quick changeover Switch between product families without major capital Mobile Equipment Equipment on wheels or air bearings for rapid repositioning Eliminate fixed foundations, reduce floor damage Flexible Utilities Overhead utility drops and floor trenches allow equipment mobility No hardwired constraints on equipment placement Digital Layout Planning Digital twins enable virtual layout testing before physical changes Reduce trial-and-error, optimize before implementation 4.14.2 Industry 4.0 Layout Considerations Figure 4.13: Industry 4.0 Enabled Plant Layout Elements 4.14.3 AGV and AMR Traffic Planning Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) require careful layout planning: Table 4.12: AGV/AMR Layout Planning Guidelines Consideration Design Guidelines Route Design Unidirectional loops preferred; minimize intersections; avoid steep grades Charging Locations Opportunity charging at pickup/dropoff points; dedicated charging bays for breaks Traffic Intersections Yield zones, traffic signals, or elevation changes at crossings Floor Requirements Smooth, level surfaces; magnetic tape or QR codes for navigation; no oil/water Safety Zones Minimum 1m clearance from pedestrian paths; light curtains at crossings Staging Areas Buffer areas for queue management; waiting positions clear of traffic Video: AGV Systems in Modern Warehouses 4.15 Layout Simulation Software Modern plant layout design relies heavily on simulation software to test alternatives before physical implementation. 4.15.1 Common Layout Planning Software Table 4.13: Plant Layout Planning Software Comparison Software Primary Use Key Features Typical Users AutoCAD Factory Design Suite 2D/3D CAD layout design Extensive equipment libraries, interference checking, material flow analysis Facility engineers, architects FlexSim 3D discrete event simulation Drag-and-drop modeling, VR capability, real-time 3D animation Industrial engineers, consultants Arena Process simulation Statistical analysis, what-if scenarios, bottleneck identification Process engineers, academics Plant Simulation (Siemens) Digital factory simulation Full Siemens integration, AGV simulation, energy analysis Large manufacturers (automotive, aerospace) SketchUp + Extensions Quick 3D visualization Low cost, easy learning curve, walkthrough capability Small businesses, initial concepts 4.15.2 Simulation Benefits Figure 4.14: Benefits of Layout Simulation ROI of Simulation: 10-20x return on simulation investment typical 30-50% reduction in layout change costs Weeks to months saved in ramp-up time Stakeholder alignment - visual communication of concepts Video: Plant Simulation Demo 4.16 Practice Problems Problem 1: Layout Selection Scenario: A company manufactures custom kitchen cabinets. Each order is unique, with different dimensions, materials, and finishes. Production volume is about 50 units per month. Question: Which layout type would you recommend and why? Answer: A process layout would be most appropriate because: - High product variety (custom orders) - Low production volume - Different operations needed for each order - Flexibility is more important than efficiency Problem 2: Line Balancing Given: - Total task time: 240 seconds - Desired output: 30 units per hour - Available time: 3600 seconds per hour Calculate: 1. Cycle time 2. Theoretical minimum number of stations 3. If you use 3 stations, what is the efficiency? Solution: 1. Cycle time = 3600 / 30 = 120 seconds 2. TM = 240 / 120 = 2 stations 3. Efficiency = (240 / (3 × 120)) × 100 = 66.7% Problem 3: Warehouse Layout Scenario: A warehouse has the following items: - Item X: 500 picks/day - Item Y: 100 picks/day - Item Z: 50 picks/day Question: How should these items be positioned relative to the shipping dock? Answer: Using ABC analysis: - Item X (high frequency): Closest to dock (A zone) - Item Y (medium frequency): Middle distance (B zone) - Item Z (low frequency): Farthest from dock (C zone) 4.17 Review Questions Question 1: What distinguishes a cellular layout from both process and product layouts? Answer: A cellular layout combines characteristics of both: From process layout: Equipment variety within each cell, flexibility to handle part variations From product layout: Sequential flow within the cell, dedicated equipment for part families Unique characteristics: Parts grouped into families using Group Technology Cells are self-contained mini-factories Workers often cross-trained to operate multiple machines Reduced material handling compared to process layout More flexibility than pure product layout Question 2: Calculate the Lifting Index for the following scenario Scenario: A worker lifts 25 kg boxes from floor level (V=0) to a shelf at waist height. The horizontal distance is 40 cm, vertical travel is 75 cm, no asymmetry, frequency is 2 lifts per minute for 4 hours, and coupling is poor (no handles). Given multipliers: - LC = 23 kg - HM = 25/H (H in cm) - VM = 1 - 0.003|V - 75| (V in cm) - DM = 0.82 + 4.5/D (D in cm) - AM = 1.0 (no asymmetry) - FM = 0.65 (from tables) - CM = 0.90 (poor coupling) Solution: HM = 25/40 = 0.625 VM = 1 - 0.003|0 - 75| = 1 - 0.225 = 0.775 DM = 0.82 + 4.5/75 = 0.82 + 0.06 = 0.88 AM = 1.0 FM = 0.65 CM = 0.90 RWL = 23 × 0.625 × 0.775 × 0.88 × 1.0 × 0.65 × 0.90 RWL = 23 × 0.625 × 0.775 × 0.88 × 0.65 × 0.90 RWL = 5.7 kg LI = 25/5.7 = 4.4 Risk Level: HIGH (LI &gt; 3.0) - Immediate redesign required Recommended actions: Raise starting height (use pallet lifter), reduce horizontal distance, add handles to boxes, reduce frequency. Question 3: List three Industry 4.0 technologies that impact plant layout design Answer: (Any three of the following) AGVs/AMRs: Require route planning, charging stations, floor markings, safety zones Collaborative robots (cobots): Need safety zones, but smaller footprint than traditional robot cells Digital twins: Enable virtual layout testing, reduce physical prototyping IoT sensors: Require network infrastructure (5G/WiFi), edge computing locations AR/VR systems: Training stations, remote assistance capabilities Flexible automation: Modular equipment, quick-connect utilities Question 4: What are the key differences between food processing plant layouts and general manufacturing? Answer: Aspect Food Processing General Manufacturing Flow direction Strictly one-way (raw → finished) Can have backtracking Zone separation Physical barriers between raw/clean Logical separation often sufficient Surfaces Sanitary design, smooth, cleanable Durability focused Temperature Multiple temperature zones (cold chain) Generally ambient Regulatory HACCP, FSMA, FDA oversight OSHA, industry standards Allergen control Dedicated lines or validated cleaning Not typically a concern Traceability Lot-level required by regulation Often batch-level sufficient Question 5: A warehouse has three product categories with the following pick frequencies. Design the storage zones. Data: - Category A: 1200 picks/day, 500 SKUs - Category B: 600 picks/day, 1500 SKUs - Category C: 200 picks/day, 3000 SKUs Solution: Using ABC analysis based on pick frequency: - Category A (60% of picks, 10% of SKUs): Prime locations closest to shipping dock - Category B (30% of picks, 30% of SKUs): Secondary locations, moderate distance - Category C (10% of picks, 60% of SKUs): Remote locations, maximum distance from dock Additional considerations: - Within each zone, use cube utilization for dense storage of slow movers - Consider pick path optimization (serpentine vs. return routing) - High-frequency items at ergonomic pick heights (waist level) - Reserve space near dock for cross-docking high-velocity items 4.18 Chapter Summary Table 4.14: Chapter 4 Summary: Plant Layout and Facility Design Topic Key Concepts Key Formulas Layout Types Fixed-position, Process, Product, Hybrid/Cellular - selected based on volume and variety Layout selection: Volume × Variety matrix Process Layout Design From-To matrix, Load-Distance model, Block plans, Closeness relationships Cost = Σ Lij × Dij × C Product Layout (Line Balancing) Cycle time, Theoretical minimum stations, Precedence diagrams, Line efficiency C = Time/Output; TM = Σti/C; Eff = Σti/(n×C) Cellular Manufacturing Group Technology, Part families, Self-contained cells, Reduced material handling Cell efficiency = Output/(Input × Time) Warehouse Design ABC analysis, High-frequency items near dock, Pick path optimization Travel distance = Σ(picks × distance) Ergonomics NIOSH lifting equation, RWL, Lifting Index, Work zones, Workstation design RWL = LC×HM×VM×DM×AM×FM×CM; LI = Weight/RWL Modern Trends Flexible layouts, Industry 4.0, AGV/AMR planning, Digital twins ROI = (Savings - Investment)/Investment Simulation FlexSim, Arena, Plant Simulation - virtual testing before physical changes Simulation accuracy &gt; 90% typical 4.19 References Reid, R.

But if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence.” — Vince Lombardi 5.2 Introduction to Lean Manufacturing Lean Manufacturing is the systematic elimination of waste. The term can be traced to Jim Womack, Daniel Jones, and Daniel Roos’ book The Machine that Changed the World (1991), which examined the Toyota Production System. What does “Lean” actually mean? The term “Lean” refers to cutting “fat” from production activities — eliminating anything that doesn’t add value to the customer. Think of it like a lean athlete: no excess weight, maximum efficiency, peak performance. 5.2.1 Definition of Lean Table 5.1: Lean Manufacturing Targets (Womack, Jones, Roos 1990) Metric Lean Target Human effort in factory Half the hours Defects in finished product Half the defects Engineering effort One-third the hours Factory space for same output Half the space In-process inventories A tenth or less 5.3 Evolution of Manufacturing Systems Manufacturing has evolved through three major paradigms. Understanding this evolution helps us appreciate why Lean emerged as the dominant philosophy. Figure 5.1: Evolution of Manufacturing Systems 5.3.1 Comparison of Manufacturing Systems Table 5.2: Evolution of Manufacturing Systems Characteristic Craft Manufacturing Mass Manufacturing Lean Manufacturing Time Period Late 1800s 1920s (Ford) 1970s - Present Process Built on blocks, workers walk around Assembly line Cells or flexible lines Workforce Craftsmen with pride Low skilled, simplistic jobs Highly skilled, proud of product Components Hand-crafted, hand-fitted Interchangeable parts Interchangeable, high variety Quality Excellent Lower Excellent (mandatory) Cost Very expensive Affordable Continuously decreasing Volume Few produced Billions - identical High volume, high variety Flexibility Very high Very low High Discussion: Why did Mass Manufacturing dominate for so long? Mass manufacturing dominated because: Economies of scale - Higher volume = lower unit cost Predictable demand - Post-war boom created stable markets Limited competition - Few global competitors Consumer acceptance - “Any color as long as it’s black” (Henry Ford) What changed? - Global competition (especially from Japan) - Customers demanded variety and quality - Product lifecycles shortened - Technology enabled flexibility 5.4 The Toyota Production System (TPS) The most influential lean manufacturing model is the Toyota Production System (TPS), developed by Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo at Toyota. 5.4.1 Historical Context Figure 5.2: Toyota’s Journey to Lean Excellence In 1949, Toyota was on the brink of bankruptcy. Ford’s car production was at least 8 times more efficient than Toyota’s. Kiichiro Toyoda’s Challenge: “To achieve the same rate of production as the United States in three years.” Taiichi Ohno accepted this challenge. Inspired by American supermarkets, he developed the Just-in-Time method. 5.4.2 Two Pillars of TPS Figure 5.3: The Two Pillars of Toyota Production System 1. Just-in-Time (JIT): Produce only what is needed, when it is needed, in the amount needed. 2. Jidoka (Built-in Quality): Automation with a human touch — stop production immediately when a defect is detected. 5.5 The 3 M’s of Lean Lean manufacturing focuses on eliminating three types of inefficiency, known as the 3 M’s: Figure 5.4: The 3 M’s of Lean Manufacturing Table 5.3: The 3 M’s Explained Japanese English Description Example Muda (無駄) Waste Activities that consume resources without adding value Excess inventory, waiting, defects Mura (斑) Inconsistency/Unevenness Variation and lack of uniformity in processes Uneven production schedules, variable quality Muri (無理) Overburden/Unreasonableness Overburdening people or equipment beyond capacity Unrealistic deadlines, overworked employees 5.6 The Seven Types of Waste (MUDA) Shigeo Shingo identified seven categories of waste common to manufacturing. These are activities that add cost without adding value. “Waste is everything that is not absolutely essential.” — Hiroyuki Hirano Figure 5.5: The Seven Types of Waste (TIMWOOD) 5.6.1 Detailed Breakdown of the Seven Wastes Table 5.4: The Seven Wastes: Detailed Analysis # Waste Type Description Examples Solution 1 Overproduction Producing more than needed, earlier than needed Building to forecast, large batch sizes Pull systems, smaller batches 2 Inventory Excess raw materials, WIP, or finished goods Safety stock, buffer inventory, obsolete stock JIT delivery, kanban systems 3 Waiting Idle time waiting for materials, information, or equipment Machine downtime, waiting for approvals TPM, better scheduling 4 Transportation Unnecessary movement of materials between processes Long distances between operations, poor layout Cellular layout, co-location 5 Over-processing Doing more work than the customer requires Tighter tolerances than needed, redundant inspections Value engineering, standardization 6 Motion Unnecessary movement of people Reaching, bending, walking to get tools 5S, ergonomic workstations 7 Defects Products that don’t meet specifications Scrap, rework, warranty claims Poka-yoke, root cause analysis Memory Aid: TIMWOOD Use TIMWOOD to remember the seven wastes: Transportation Inventory Motion Waiting Overproduction Over-processing Defects Some people also use DOWNTIME (adding “Non-utilized talent” as an 8th waste). Interactive Exercise: Identify the Waste Scenario 1: A worker walks 50 feet to get a tool, uses it for 30 seconds, then walks back. Answer: This is Motion waste. The solution would be to place tools at the point of use (5S). Scenario 2: A machine produces 1000 parts, but only 800 are needed this week. Answer: This is Overproduction waste. The solution would be to implement pull production based on actual demand. Scenario 3: Parts sit in a queue for 3 days before being processed at the next station. Answer: This is both Inventory and Waiting waste. The solution would be to balance the line and implement one-piece flow. 5.7 The 5S Methodology 5S is a workplace organization methodology that creates a clean, efficient, and safe working environment. Figure 5.6: The 5S Methodology Table 5.5: The 5S Steps Explained Step Japanese English Action Key Question 1S Seiri Sort Remove unnecessary items from the workplace Do we need this? 2S Seiton Set in Order Organize items so they are easy to find and use Where does this belong? 3S Seiso Shine Clean the workplace regularly Is everything clean? 4S Seiketsu Standardize Create standards for maintaining 1S-3S How do we keep it this way? 5S Shitsuke Sustain Build discipline to maintain standards Are we following our standards? 5.7.1 Visual Factory “The ability to understand the status of a production area in 5 minutes or less by simple observation without use of computers or speaking to anyone.” A well-implemented 5S creates a visual factory where problems are immediately apparent. 5.8 Just-in-Time (JIT) Production 5.8.1 The JIT Philosophy “Deliver the right material, in the exact quantity, with perfect quality, in the right place, just before it is needed.” — Ohno and Shingo ## Warning in geom_segment(aes(x = 5.4, xend = 5.9, y = 1, yend = 1), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, : All aesthetics have length 1, but ## the data has 5 rows. ## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` ## or provide this layer with data ## containing a single row.

Figure 5.9: Example Kanban Card 5.9 Key Time Metrics Understanding time metrics is essential for lean manufacturing analysis and improvement. 5.9.1 Definitions Figure 5.10: Relationship Between Time Metrics 5.9.2 Formulas and Calculations Takt Time — The pace of production to meet customer demand: \\[\\text{Takt Time} = \\frac{\\text{Available Production Time}}{\\text{Customer Demand}}\\] Cycle Time — Time to complete one unit at a workstation: \\[\\text{Cycle Time} = \\frac{\\text{Net Operating Time}}{\\text{Units Produced}}\\] Throughput Time — Total time from start to finish: \\[\\text{Throughput Time} = \\text{Processing} + \\text{Inspection} + \\text{Queue} + \\text{Move Time}\\] 5.9.3 Interactive Example: Calculating Takt Time # Given data available_time_per_day &lt;- 8 * 60 # 8 hours = 480 minutes breaks_and_meetings &lt;- 60 # 60 minutes for breaks/meetings customer_demand &lt;- 240 # 240 units per day # Calculate net available time net_available_time &lt;- available_time_per_day - breaks_and_meetings cat(&quot;Net Available Time:&quot;, net_available_time, &quot;minutes/day\\n&quot;) ## Net Available Time: 420 minutes/day # Calculate Takt Time takt_time &lt;- net_available_time / customer_demand cat(&quot;Takt Time:&quot;, takt_time, &quot;minutes per unit\\n&quot;) ## Takt Time: 1.75 minutes per unit cat(&quot;Takt Time:&quot;, takt_time * 60, &quot;seconds per unit\\n&quot;) ## Takt Time: 105 seconds per unit # Interpretation cat(&quot;\\n--- Interpretation ---\\n&quot;) ## ## --- Interpretation --- cat(&quot;To meet customer demand, we must produce 1 unit every&quot;, takt_time, &quot;minutes (&quot;, takt_time * 60, &quot;seconds).\\n&quot;) ## To meet customer demand, we must produce 1 unit every 1.75 minutes ( 105 seconds). Practice Problem: Calculate Your Takt Time Given: - Shift length: 10 hours - Two 15-minute breaks and one 30-minute lunch - Customer requires 300 units per shift Calculate: 1. Net available production time 2. Takt time in minutes 3. Takt time in seconds Solution: Net time = (10 × 60) - (15 + 15 + 30) = 600 - 60 = 540 minutes Takt time = 540 / 300 = 1.8 minutes = 108 seconds per unit 5.10 Setup Reduction (SMED) SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Dies) is a methodology developed by Shigeo Shingo to dramatically reduce changeover time. 5.10.1 The SMED Concept Figure 5.11: SMED: Internal vs External Setup 5.10.2 SMED Methodology Table 5.7: The Four Steps of SMED Step Action Description Example 1 Document current process Video the entire changeover, identify all steps Time each step of die change 2 Separate internal and external Internal = machine must be stopped; External = can be done while running Getting tools = external; Removing die = internal 3 Convert internal to external Find ways to perform ‘internal’ tasks while machine is running Pre-stage next die, pre-heat tools 4 Streamline all operations Reduce time for remaining internal tasks through better methods Use quick-release clamps instead of bolts Case Study: Press Setup Reduction Problem: Presses were idle more than 50% of the time due to setup. - Average production run: 1-2 days - Setup time: 1-2 days Root Cause Analysis: - Using standard bolt fasteners with open-end wrenches - No pre-staging of tools or dies - Sequential operations that could be parallel Solutions Implemented: Change Time Saved Socket sets + power tools 10% Quick-release clamps 50% Pre-staging materials 20% Parallel operations 20% Result: Setup time reduced from 1-2 days to 4-6 hours, with a target of under 1 hour. 5.11 Kaizen: Continuous Improvement Kaizen (改善) means “change for the better” — the philosophy of continuous, incremental improvement. 5.11.1 Kaizen Principles Figure 5.12: The Kaizen Continuous Improvement Cycle 5.11.2 Key Kaizen Concepts Everyone participates — from CEO to frontline workers Small, incremental changes — not major overhauls Focus on process — blame the process, not the person Data-driven decisions — measure before and after Standardize improvements — lock in gains 5.12 Value Stream Mapping (VSM) Value Stream Mapping is a lean tool for analyzing the flow of materials and information required to bring a product to the customer. 5.12.1 VSM Symbols Table 5.8: Key Metrics in Value Stream Maps Metric Description Typical Location Process Time (PT) Time to actually process one unit In process box Lead Time (LT) Total time from raw material to finished good Timeline at bottom Changeover Time (C/O) Time to switch between products In process box Uptime Percentage of time equipment is available In process box Takt Time Required pace to meet demand Noted on map WIP Inventory Units waiting between processes Triangle symbol between processes 5.13 Summary Table 5.9: Lean Manufacturing: Key Concepts Summary Concept Definition Key Benefit Lean Manufacturing Systematic elimination of waste Reduced cost, improved quality 3 M’s Muda (waste), Mura (inconsistency), Muri (overburden) Framework for identifying improvement opportunities 7 Wastes TIMWOOD: Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Over-processing, Defects Systematic waste identification 5S Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain Organized, efficient workplace JIT Right part, right quantity, right quality, right place, right time Minimal inventory, fast response Kanban Visual signal system for pull production Controlled WIP, smooth flow SMED Single Minute Exchange of Dies - rapid changeover Flexibility, reduced batch sizes Kaizen Continuous incremental improvement Engaged workforce, sustained improvement 5.14 Review Questions Question 1: What are the seven types of waste, and which is often considered the most impactful? The seven types of waste (TIMWOOD) are: 1. Transportation 2. Inventory 3. Motion 4. Waiting 5. Overproduction 6. Over-processing 7. Defects Inventory is often considered the most impactful because it hides other problems, ties up capital, and can become obsolete. Question 2: Explain the difference between Push and Pull production systems. Push System: - Production based on forecasts - Materials pushed through the system - Results in high inventory - Problems hidden by buffer stock Pull System: - Production triggered by actual demand - Materials pulled by downstream operations - Minimal inventory - Problems immediately visible Question 3: Calculate the Takt time for a facility with 450 minutes of available time and demand of 150 units. \\[\\text{Takt Time} = \\frac{450 \\text{ minutes}}{150 \\text{ units}} = 3 \\text{ minutes per unit}\\] This means we need to produce one unit every 3 minutes (180 seconds) to meet customer demand. Question 4: What is the difference between internal and external setup in SMED? Internal Setup: Activities that can ONLY be performed when the machine is stopped (e.g., physically removing the old die). External Setup: Activities that CAN be performed while the machine is still running (e.g., getting tools, pre-staging the next die, preparing materials). The key to SMED is converting as many internal activities to external as possible. 5.15 References Womack, J., Jones, D., &amp; Roos, D. (1990). The Machine that Changed the World. Ohno, T. (1988).

Before deploying safety devices, the engineer must apply the Hierarchy of Controls — a systematic approach to eliminating or reducing workplace hazards. Figure 6.1: The Hierarchy of Controls (Most to Least Effective) Table 6.1: Hierarchy of Controls: Detailed Breakdown Priority Control Level Description Example Effectiveness 1 Elimination Physically remove the hazard entirely Eliminate pinch point by redesigning mechanism Most Effective 2 Substitution Replace with something less hazardous Use lower voltage (24V DC instead of 120V AC) Very Effective 3 Engineering Controls Isolate people from the hazard through design Install machine guarding, light curtains, interlocks Effective 4 Administrative Controls Change the way people work Safety procedures, training, warning signs, lock-out/tag-out Less Effective 5 PPE Protect the worker with equipment Safety glasses, gloves, steel-toe boots, hearing protection Least Effective Discussion: Why not just rely on PPE? PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) is the least effective control because: It doesn’t eliminate the hazard — the danger still exists It depends on human compliance — workers may forget or choose not to wear it It can fail — equipment degrades, doesn’t fit properly, or is damaged It’s the last line of defense — if PPE fails, the worker is exposed Key Principle: The more we can design out hazards through engineering controls, the less we depend on human behavior to keep people safe. “If you have to post a warning sign, you’ve already failed at design.” 6.3 Physical Guarding and Interlocks Physical barriers are the most intuitive form of protection. They create a “hard” separation between the operator and moving parts, ensuring that humans cannot enter the danger zone during machine operation. Figure 6.2: Types of Physical Guarding 6.3.1 Fixed Guards Fixed guards are permanent barriers that require tools to remove. They are the simplest and most reliable form of protection. Table 6.2: Fixed Guards: Key Characteristics Characteristic Description Construction Wire mesh, polycarbonate sheets, or solid metal panels Removal Requires tools (screws, bolts) to remove Best Application Areas that need infrequent access for maintenance only Advantages Simple, reliable, low cost, no moving parts to fail Disadvantages Impedes visibility, slows maintenance, can be removed and not replaced 6.3.2 Interlocked Guards Interlocked guards are access points equipped with sensors. When the guard is opened, the safety controller initiates a stop. Figure 6.3: Interlocked Guard Operation Principle 6.3.3 Stop Categories When an interlock is triggered, the machine must stop. The stop category determines how this happens: Table 6.3: Machine Stop Categories (IEC 60204-1) Category Type Method Application Example Category 0 Uncontrolled Stop Immediate removal of power to actuators Emergency stops, dangerous machines Press brake E-stop Category 1 Controlled Stop Controlled deceleration, then power removed High-inertia machines, robots Industrial robot guard open Category 2 Controlled Stop Controlled stop with power maintained Process that cannot be interrupted abruptly CNC spindle during tool change 6.3.4 Trapped Key Systems (Lock-Out/Tag-Out) Trapped key systems use a mechanical sequence to ensure that a machine cannot be energized unless all access keys are returned to the control panel. Figure 6.4: Trapped Key System Sequence Case Study: The Fatal Bypass Incident: A maintenance worker was killed when a robot arm unexpectedly activated while he was inside a robotic cell. What Happened: - The guard interlock had been bypassed with a “defeat device” (a magnet taped to fool the sensor) - Workers had bypassed the interlock because it slowed down troubleshooting - The bypass had been in place for months without management knowledge Root Causes: 1. Interlock caused inconvenience during frequent troubleshooting 2. No monitoring system to detect bypasses 3. Culture that tolerated “workarounds” Lessons Learned: - Design interlocks that don’t impede normal operations - Use tamper-evident or tamper-resistant devices - Regular safety audits to detect bypasses - Zero-tolerance policy for defeating safety devices Never bypass a safety device, even temporarily. 6.4 Presence-Sensing Devices Presence-sensing devices allow for a “fence-less” environment, improving visibility and ergonomics while maintaining high safety levels. They detect when a person enters a hazardous zone and trigger a machine stop. Figure 6.5: Types of Presence-Sensing Devices 6.4.1 Light Curtains Light curtains use a transmitter and receiver to create an array of infrared beams. If any beam is broken, the safety circuit is interrupted. Figure 6.6: Light Curtain Operating Principle Table 6.4: Light Curtain Specifications by Application Parameter Finger Detection (14mm) Hand Detection (30mm) Body Detection (40mm+) Resolution 14mm beam spacing 30mm beam spacing 40mm+ beam spacing Height 150-1800mm 300-1800mm 900-2000mm Range 0.5-20m 0.5-20m 0.5-30m Response Time 5-15ms 10-20ms 15-30ms Application Point of operation guarding Perimeter guarding Area access detection 6.4.2 Laser Area Scanners Laser area scanners use LiDAR technology to monitor a 2D plane. They are highly flexible and allow for programmable zones. Figure 6.7: Laser Area Scanner Zones Table 6.5: Light Curtains vs. Area Scanners Feature Light Curtains Area Scanners Detection Type Vertical/Linear Barrier Horizontal/Area Coverage Flexibility Fixed installation Programmable zones Zone Configuration Single detection plane Multiple warning + safety zones Cost Generally lower ($1,000-5,000) Higher ($3,000-10,000) Best Use Case Clear entry/exit points, press brakes Large open floors, AGV paths, flexible cells Environmental Limits Dust/debris can cause false trips More tolerant of dust, outdoor rated available 6.4.3 Pressure-Sensitive Safety Mats Pressure-sensitive mats detect the presence of a person standing on them. They are used primarily in legacy systems or specific zones where optical sensors may be obscured. Figure 6.8: Pressure-Sensitive Safety Mat Construction When to Use Pressure Mats vs. Optical Sensors Use Pressure Mats When: - Environment has heavy dust, smoke, or steam (blinds optical sensors) - Detection area is well-defined and doesn’t change - Workers need to stand in a specific location - Budget is limited Use Optical Sensors When: - Flexibility in zone configuration is needed - Environment is relatively clean - Detection area is large or needs to change - Higher integrity level is required Hybrid Approach: Many modern systems use both — area scanners for perimeter protection and pressure mats for specific danger zones near the machine. 6.5 Control-Actuated Safety Devices These devices ensure that the operator’s body—specifically their hands—is in a predetermined safe location before the machine can cycle. 6.5.1 Two-Hand Controls Two-hand controls are common in pressing or stamping operations. To initiate a cycle, the operator must press two buttons simultaneously. Figure 6.9: Two-Hand Control System Anti-Tie-Down Requirement: Modern systems require both buttons to be pressed within 0.5 seconds of each other. This prevents operators from taping one button down to work with one hand. Table 6.6: Two-Hand Control Requirements Requirement Standard Value Purpose Synchronous activation Within 0.5 seconds Prevents one-hand operation Continuous pressure Must be held throughout cycle Ensures hands stay on controls Release before restart Both must be released before next cycle Prevents automatic cycling Button spacing Minimum 260mm (10 inches) apart Cannot press both with one hand/arm Guards around buttons Prevent accidental activation Prevents hip, elbow, or object activation 6.5.2 Enable/Deadman Switches Enable switches (also called deadman switches) are used during Teach Mode for robotics. The operator must hold a three-position trigger in the middle position. Figure 6.10: Three-Position Enable Switch Operation Why Three Positions? The three-position design accounts for two natural human reactions to danger: Panic (Release): When frightened, people often release what they’re holding — robot stops. Startle (Squeeze): When startled, people often grip tighter — robot stops. Only a deliberate, controlled middle hold allows the robot to move. This is fundamental to safe teach pendant operation. 6.6 Collaborative Robotics (Cobots) Collaborative robots (cobots) represent a shift from “separation” to “collaboration.” They rely on sophisticated internal sensors rather than external cages, allowing humans and robots to work in the same space. Figure 6.11: Traditional Robot vs. Collaborative Robot 6.6.1 Collaborative Operation Methods ISO 10218 and ISO/TS 15066 define four methods for safe collaborative operation: Table 6.7: Four Methods of Collaborative Robot Operation Method How It Works Sensors Used Application Safety-Rated Monitored Stop Robot stops when human enters workspace, resumes when clear Area scanners, light curtains Large robot needing occasional access Hand Guiding Operator physically guides robot through motions Force/torque sensors in joints Teaching, positioning Speed and Separation Monitoring Robot slows or stops based on human proximity Area scanners, radar, cameras Shared workspace with varying proximity Power and Force Limiting Robot limits force/power to safe levels on contact Joint torque sensors Direct contact applications 6.6.2 Power and Force Limiting (PFL) The most common cobot safety method is Power and Force Limiting. The robot detects a change in torque in its joints. If it bumps into a human, it stops before a regulated amount of force is exceeded. Table 6.8: ISO/TS 15066 Biomechanical Limits (Quasi-static contact) Body Region Maximum Pressure (N/cm²) Maximum Force (N) Risk Level Skull/Forehead 130 130 Critical Face 65 65 Critical Neck 145 150 Critical Back/Shoulders 210 210 Moderate Chest 140 140 Moderate Abdomen 110 110 Moderate Hand/Fingers 300 140 Lower Discussion: Are Cobots Always Safe? Common Misconception: “Cobots are safe, so we don’t need to do a risk assessment.” Reality: Cobots are potentially safe, but a risk assessment is always required. Factors that can make a cobot unsafe: End-of-arm tooling — A soft gripper is different from a sharp blade Workpiece — Carrying a heavy or sharp object increases risk Speed — Even force-limited robots can cause injury at high speed Application — Some tasks bring humans closer to hazards Environment — Slippery floors, confined spaces, etc. Every collaborative application requires a documented risk assessment per ISO 12100. 6.7 Safety Distance Calculation A safety device cannot be placed arbitrarily. It must be far enough away that the machine comes to a complete halt before the human can reach the hazard. 6.7.1 The Safety Distance Formula The minimum safety distance \\(S\\) is calculated as: \\[S = (K \\times T) + C\\] Where: \\(K\\): The hand/body approach speed (standardized values) \\(T\\): The total stopping time of the system (device response + machine stop time) \\(C\\): The “penetration depth” (how far a hand can reach through before being detected) Figure 6.12: Safety Distance Components 6.7.2 Standard Values for K Table 6.9: Standard Approach Speed Values (ISO 13855) Approach Type K Value (mm/s) When to Use Hand/Arm Approach (fast) 2000 Close approach to point of operation Hand/Arm Approach (normal) 1600 General approach to machines Walking Approach 1600 Area access detection Standing Reach 0 (static) Worker already in position 6.7.3 Penetration Depth (C) The penetration depth depends on the resolution of the sensing device: Table 6.10: Penetration Depth Values Based on Resolution Resolution (mm) C Value (mm) Detection Type ≤14 0 Finger detection &gt;14 to ≤20 80 Finger/Hand &gt;20 to ≤30 130 Hand detection &gt;30 to ≤40 240 Hand/Arm &gt;40 850 Body detection 6.7.4 Example Calculation # Given parameters K &lt;- 2000 # Approach speed (mm/s) - fast hand approach T_device &lt;- 0.020 # Light curtain response time (20 ms = 0.020 s) T_machine &lt;- 0.150 # Machine stopping time (150 ms = 0.150 s) C &lt;- 0 # Penetration depth for 14mm resolution # Calculate total stopping time T_total &lt;- T_device + T_machine cat(&quot;Total stopping time (T):&quot;, T_total * 1000, &quot;ms\\n&quot;) ## Total stopping time (T): 170 ms # Calculate minimum safety distance S &lt;- (K * T_total) + C cat(&quot;Minimum safety distance (S):&quot;, S, &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## Minimum safety distance (S): 340 mm cat(&quot;Minimum safety distance (S):&quot;, S / 25.4, &quot;inches\\n&quot;) ## Minimum safety distance (S): 13.38583 inches # Interpretation cat(&quot;\\n--- Interpretation ---\\n&quot;) ## ## --- Interpretation --- cat(&quot;The light curtain must be at least&quot;, S, &quot;mm from the hazard.\\n&quot;) ## The light curtain must be at least 340 mm from the hazard. cat(&quot;This ensures the machine stops before a person can reach the danger zone.\\n&quot;) ## This ensures the machine stops before a person can reach the danger zone. Practice Problem: Calculate Safety Distance Given: - Light curtain resolution: 30mm (hand detection) - Light curtain response time: 15ms - Machine stopping time: 200ms - Application: Operator hand approach Calculate the minimum safety distance. Solution: K = 1600 mm/s (normal hand approach) T = 0.015 + 0.200 = 0.215 seconds C = 130 mm (for 30mm resolution) S = (K × T) + C S = (1600 × 0.215) + 130 S = 344 + 130 S = 474 mm (approximately 18.7 inches) The light curtain must be installed at least 474mm from the nearest hazard point. 6.8 Emergency Stop (E-Stop) Systems The Emergency Stop is the “last resort” — it is not a safety device but a complementary protective measure. It must be available to stop the machine when all other measures have failed. Figure 6.13: E-Stop Design Requirements Table 6.11: E-Stop Requirements per IEC 60204-1 Requirement Standard Color Red (RAL 3000 or equivalent) Shape Mushroom head (palm or fist operated) Background Yellow (high contrast) Operation Self-latching (stays activated when pressed) Reset Manual reset required (twist, pull, or key) Accessibility Within easy reach of all operators Wiring Normally closed contacts (fail-safe) Function Category 0 or Category 1 stop 6.8.1 E-Stop Pull Cords For long conveyors or machines where an operator cannot quickly reach a fixed button, pull cords provide continuous E-Stop coverage. Figure 6.14: E-Stop Pull Cord System Common E-Stop Mistakes Mistake 1: Using E-Stop for normal stopping - E-Stops are for emergencies only - Normal stops should use a separate control - Frequent E-Stop use causes wear and desensitizes operators Mistake 2: E-Stop that doesn’t stop everything - All hazardous motion must stop - Auxiliary equipment (conveyors, feeders) often forgotten - Review entire system, not just the primary machine Mistake 3: Automatic restart after E-Stop reset - Machine must NOT automatically restart when E-Stop is released - Separate “Start” action required - This prevents unexpected motion after reset Mistake 4: Hidden or blocked E-Stops - E-Stops must be visible and accessible - Guard placement sometimes blocks access - Regular audits needed to ensure accessibility 6.9 Functional Safety Standards Modern safety systems must meet specific performance levels to ensure reliability. Two main frameworks exist: 6.9.1 Safety Integrity Levels (SIL) - IEC 62061 Table 6.12: Safety Integrity Levels (PFH = Probability of Dangerous Failure per Hour) SIL Level PFH Range Approximate Meaning Typical Application SIL 1 ≥10⁻⁶ to &lt;10⁻⁵ Dangerous failure less than once per 11 years Low-risk tasks SIL 2 ≥10⁻⁷ to &lt;10⁻⁶ Dangerous failure less than once per 114 years Most industrial machinery SIL 3 ≥10⁻⁸ to &lt;10⁻⁷ Dangerous failure less than once per 1,140 years High-risk processes 6.9.2 Performance Levels (PL) - ISO 13849-1 Table 6.13: Performance Levels per ISO 13849-1 Performance Level PFH Range Risk Reduction Equivalent SIL PL a ≥10⁻⁵ to &lt;10⁻⁴ Lowest &lt; SIL 1 PL b ≥3×10⁻⁶ to &lt;10⁻⁵ Low SIL 1 PL c ≥10⁻⁶ to &lt;3×10⁻⁶ Medium SIL 1 PL d ≥10⁻⁷ to &lt;10⁻⁶ High SIL 2 PL e ≥10⁻⁸ to &lt;10⁻⁷ Highest SIL 3 Figure 6.15: Relationship Between SIL and PL Which Standard to Use: SIL or PL? Use ISO 13849-1 (Performance Levels) when: - Designing safety functions for standard machinery - Using off-the-shelf safety components - Simpler systems with well-defined safety functions Use IEC 62061 (SIL) when: - Complex programmable systems (safety PLCs) - Process industries - When customer or regulation specifies SIL Note: Many modern systems use both standards, as they are harmonized and can be used together. The choice often depends on industry practice and customer requirements. 6.10 Risk Assessment Process Before selecting any safety device, a risk assessment must be performed. This is required by ISO 12100. Figure 6.16: Risk Assessment Process (ISO 12100) 6.10.1 Risk Estimation Risk is typically estimated using three factors: Figure 6.17: Risk Estimation Matrix 6.11 Summary Table 6.14: Machine Guarding and Safety: Key Concepts Summary Topic Key Points Critical Remember Hierarchy of Controls Elimination &gt; Substitution &gt; Engineering &gt; Administrative &gt; PPE Always start at the top of the hierarchy Physical Guarding Fixed guards, interlocked gates, trapped key systems Stop category (0, 1, 2) determines how machine stops Presence Sensing Light curtains, area scanners, pressure mats Resolution determines detection capability Control-Actuated Devices Two-hand controls, enable/deadman switches Anti-tie-down prevents one-hand bypass Collaborative Robots PFL, speed/separation monitoring, hand guiding Risk assessment required for every cobot application Safety Distance S = (K × T) + C formula for device placement Include device response AND machine stop time E-Stop Systems Red mushroom on yellow, self-latching, manual reset E-Stop is last resort, not normal operation Functional Safety SIL (IEC 62061) and PL (ISO 13849-1) standards Required performance level from risk assessment 6.12 Review Questions Question 1: What are the five levels of the Hierarchy of Controls, and why is PPE the least effective? The five levels are (from most to least effective): Elimination — Physically remove the hazard Substitution — Replace with something less hazardous Engineering Controls — Isolate people from the hazard Administrative Controls — Change how people work PPE — Protect the worker with equipment PPE is least effective because: - The hazard still exists - It depends on human compliance - Equipment can fail or be worn incorrectly - It’s the last line of defense Question 2: A light curtain has a response time of 12ms and resolution of 14mm. The machine takes 180ms to stop. Calculate the minimum safety distance for hand approach. Given: - K = 2000 mm/s (hand approach, use higher value for safety) - T = 0.012 + 0.180 = 0.192 seconds - C = 0 mm (14mm resolution) Calculation: \\[S = (K \\times T) + C\\] \\[S = (2000 \\times 0.192) + 0\\] \\[S = 384 \\text{ mm}\\] The light curtain must be installed at least 384mm (approximately 15 inches) from the hazard. Question 3: Explain why a three-position enable switch stops the robot in both position 1 (released) and position 3 (fully pressed). The three-position design accounts for two natural human reactions to danger: Position 1 (Released): - When frightened, people often release what they’re holding (panic response) - Robot stops immediately Position 3 (Fully Pressed): - When startled, people often grip tighter (startle response) - Robot stops immediately Position 2 (Middle): - Only a deliberate, controlled hold allows operation - Requires conscious effort to maintain - This ensures the operator is alert and in control Question 4: What are the four methods of collaborative robot operation according to ISO 10218? Safety-Rated Monitored Stop Robot stops when human enters workspace Resumes when human leaves Uses area scanners or light curtains Hand Guiding Operator physically guides robot Force/torque sensors enable safe teaching Speed and Separation Monitoring Robot speed varies based on human proximity Uses external sensors to track human position Power and Force Limiting (PFL) Robot limits contact force to safe levels Built-in joint torque sensors Most common cobot method Question 5: What are the requirements for an E-Stop button according to IEC 60204-1? Physical Requirements: - Color: Red - Shape: Mushroom head (palm or fist operated) - Background: Yellow (high contrast) Functional Requirements: - Self-latching: Stays activated when pressed - Manual reset: Requires deliberate action to release - Accessibility: Within easy reach of all operators - Wiring: Normally closed contacts (fail-safe) - Function: Category 0 or Category 1 stop - No automatic restart: Separate start action required after reset 6.13 References ISO 12100:2010 — Safety of machinery — General principles for design — Risk assessment and risk reduction ISO 13849-1:2015 — Safety of machinery — Safety-related parts of control systems ISO 13855:2010 — Safety of machinery — Positioning of safeguards with respect to approach speeds ISO 10218-1/2:2011 — Robots and robotic devices — Safety requirements for industrial robots ISO/TS 15066:2016 — Robots and robotic devices — Collaborative robots IEC 60204-1:2016 — Safety of machinery — Electrical equipment of machines IEC 62061:2021 — Safety of machinery — Functional safety of safety-related control systems OSHA 29 CFR 1910.212 — General requirements for all machines ANSI/RIA TR R15.306 — Task-based risk assessment methodology "],["ergonomics-in-automated-manufacturing.html", "Chapter 7 Ergonomics in Automated Manufacturing 7.1 Learning Objectives 7.2 What is Ergonomics? 7.3 The Seven Ergonomic Risk Factors 7.4 Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) 7.5 Preventing MSDs: Best Practices 7.6 Ergonomic Design Principles 7.7 Ergonomic Assessment Tools 7.8 AI-Powered Ergonomic Assessment 7.9 Ergonomics in Automated Manufacturing 7.10 Employer Responsibilities 7.11 Case Study: Ergonomics in Automated Assembly 7.12 Summary 7.13 Review Questions 7.14 Additional Resources 7.15 References", " Chapter 7 Ergonomics in Automated Manufacturing 7.1 Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will be able to: Define ergonomics and explain its importance in manufacturing Identify the seven major ergonomic risk factors Recognize common musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and their causes Apply ergonomic design principles to workstation design Conduct a REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment) analysis Understand the role of AI and automation in ergonomic assessment Design workstations that optimize human performance and safety “Ergonomics is the science of fitting the job to the worker, not forcing the worker to fit the job.” — International Ergonomics Association 7.2 What is Ergonomics? Ergonomics (from Greek ergon = work, nomos = laws) is the scientific discipline focused on understanding the interactions between humans and other elements of a system, with the goal of optimizing human well-being and overall system performance. Figure 7.1: The Three Domains of Ergonomics Table 7.1: The Three Domains of Ergonomics Domain Focus Key Topics Manufacturing Example Physical Ergonomics Human body’s response to physical stress Posture, material handling, repetitive motion, workplace layout, safety Designing assembly workstations to reduce reaching Cognitive Ergonomics Mental processes and human-system interaction Mental workload, decision-making, human-computer interaction, training Designing HMI screens for quick comprehension Organizational Ergonomics Optimization of sociotechnical systems Communication, teamwork, work schedules, quality management Implementing job rotation to reduce fatigue 7.2.1 Why Ergonomics Matters in Manufacturing Figure 7.2: The Business Case for Ergonomics The Cost of Ignoring Ergonomics Direct Costs: - Workers’ compensation claims - Medical expenses - Legal fees - Increased insurance premiums Indirect Costs (often 4-10x direct costs): - Lost productivity - Training replacement workers - Reduced quality - Overtime to cover absent workers - Administrative time - Low morale Statistics: - MSDs account for 33% of all workplace injuries - Average MSD claim costs $15,000-$20,000 - Lost workdays due to MSDs average 12 days per case - Carpal tunnel surgery costs approximately $30,000 per case (including lost time) 7.3 The Seven Ergonomic Risk Factors The Initial Ergonomic Risk Assessment (INERA) identifies seven primary risk factors that contribute to musculoskeletal disorders. Understanding these factors is the first step in prevention. Figure 7.3: The Seven Ergonomic Risk Factors Table 7.2: The Seven Ergonomic Risk Factors Explained # Risk Factor Definition Examples Body Areas Affected 1 Awkward Postures Positions that deviate from neutral body alignment Bent wrist, raised arms, twisted back, kneeling Back, neck, shoulders, wrists, knees 2 Repetition Performing the same motion repeatedly Assembly line tasks, typing, packaging Hands, wrists, shoulders, neck 3 Force Amount of physical effort required to do a task Lifting heavy objects, pushing/pulling, gripping tools Back, shoulders, hands, arms 4 Static Positions Maintaining the same position for extended periods Standing in one spot, holding arms overhead Legs, back, shoulders, neck 5 Contact Stress Pressure from hard surfaces or edges on body tissues Resting wrists on desk edge, kneeling on hard floor Hands, knees, forearms 6 Vibration Oscillating movements transferred to the body Power tools, driving forklifts, jackhammers Hands, arms, spine 7 Environmental Factors Temperature, lighting, noise affecting work performance Cold environments, poor lighting, excessive noise Eyes, ears, overall fatigue 7.3.1 Risk Factor 1: Awkward Postures Neutral posture is the position where joints are naturally aligned, minimizing stress on muscles, tendons, and skeletal system. Any deviation from neutral increases injury risk. Figure 7.4: Posture Risk Zones Table 7.3: Neutral vs. Awkward Postures by Body Part Body Part Neutral Position Awkward Position Risk Head/Neck Balanced on spine, looking straight ahead Bent forward &gt;20°, tilted, twisted Neck pain, headaches Shoulders Relaxed, arms at sides Raised, reaching overhead, behind body Shoulder impingement, rotator cuff Elbows Close to body, bent 90-120° Fully extended or tightly bent Tennis elbow, golfer’s elbow Wrists Straight, in line with forearm Bent up/down, twisted side-to-side Carpal tunnel, tendinitis Back Natural S-curve maintained Bent forward, twisted, arched Low back pain, disc herniation Hips/Knees Thighs parallel to floor, feet flat Squatting, kneeling, twisted Knee injuries, hip pain 7.3.2 Risk Factor 2: Repetition Repetitive motion is one of the most significant risk factors in manufacturing. The risk increases with: Frequency: How often the motion occurs Duration: How long the task is performed Recovery time: Rest between repetitions Table 7.4: Repetition Risk Thresholds Cycle Time Repetitions/Hour Risk Level Action Required &gt; 30 seconds &lt; 120 Low Monitor 15-30 seconds 120-240 Moderate Investigate and consider changes &lt; 15 seconds &gt; 240 High Immediate intervention needed 7.3.3 Risk Factor 3: Force The amount of physical effort required significantly impacts injury risk. Force requirements depend on: Figure 7.5: Factors Affecting Force Requirements Interactive Exercise: Identify the Risk Factors Scenario: An assembly line worker performs the following task 400 times per shift: Reaches overhead to grab a part from a bin Holds the part while inserting 4 screws with a power screwdriver Places the completed assembly on a conveyor The workstation has poor lighting and the floor is concrete Identify all risk factors present: Answer: 1. Awkward Posture - Reaching overhead 2. Repetition - 400 cycles per shift 3. Force - Gripping parts, controlling screwdriver 4. Static Position - Holding part during assembly 5. Vibration - Power screwdriver 6. Contact Stress - Standing on concrete (feet) 7. Environmental - Poor lighting This task has ALL SEVEN risk factors present! 7.4 Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) are injuries and disorders affecting muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage, and spinal discs. They are the most common and costly occupational health problem. Figure 7.6: Common MSDs by Body Region Table 7.5: Common Musculoskeletal Disorders in Manufacturing Disorder Description Causes Symptoms Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Compression of median nerve in the wrist Repetitive wrist motions, forceful gripping, vibration Numbness, tingling, weakness in hand Tendinitis Inflammation of tendons from overuse Repetitive motions, awkward postures, force Pain, swelling, stiffness in affected area Low Back Pain Strain or injury to muscles/discs of lower back Heavy lifting, bending, twisting, vibration Pain, stiffness, limited mobility Rotator Cuff Injury Damage to shoulder tendons Overhead work, repetitive shoulder motion Pain, weakness, limited range of motion Epicondylitis Inflammation of elbow tendons (tennis/golfer’s elbow) Repetitive arm/wrist motions, forceful gripping Pain on outside (tennis) or inside (golfer’s) of elbow Trigger Finger Finger gets stuck in bent position Repetitive gripping, hand tools Clicking, locking of finger 7.4.1 The MSD Development Cycle MSDs typically develop gradually through a predictable cycle: Figure 7.7: The MSD Development Cycle Warning Signs: When to Take Action Early Warning Signs (Act Immediately): - Persistent fatigue in specific body parts - Discomfort during or after work - Tightness or stiffness - Minor aching or soreness Serious Warning Signs (Seek Medical Attention): - Persistent pain that doesn’t go away with rest - Numbness or tingling - Loss of strength or grip - Swelling or inflammation - Reduced range of motion - Pain that wakes you at night Key Message: Report symptoms early! The earlier the intervention, the better the outcome. 7.5 Preventing MSDs: Best Practices Prevention is far more effective and less costly than treatment. Here are evidence-based strategies for MSD prevention: Figure 7.8: MSD Prevention Hierarchy Table 7.6: MSD Prevention Strategies Strategy Engineering Solutions Worker Actions Maintain Neutral Posture Adjustable workstations, proper tool selection Awareness of body position, stretching Reduce Repetition Automation, job rotation between stations Vary tasks when possible Minimize Force Mechanical assists, better handles, lighter parts Use tools properly, ask for help with heavy items Avoid Static Positions Sit-stand workstations, adjustable fixtures Shift weight, change positions frequently Eliminate Contact Stress Padding, rounded edges, anti-fatigue mats Use padding, wear appropriate PPE Control Vibration Vibration-dampening tools, isolation mounts Limit exposure time, grip tools lightly Optimize Environment Proper lighting, climate control, noise reduction Report issues, use available controls Allow Recovery Rest break areas, micro-break reminders Take breaks, report fatigue 7.5.1 Proper Lifting Technique Improper lifting is a leading cause of back injuries. The NIOSH lifting equation provides guidelines, but proper technique is fundamental. Figure 7.9: Proper Lifting Technique 7.6 Ergonomic Design Principles Effective ergonomic design follows established principles that account for human capabilities and limitations. Figure 7.10: Ergonomic Design Principles Table 7.7: Ergonomic Design Principles in Detail Principle Description Implementation 1. Neutral Posture Design to promote natural, balanced body positions Adjustable workstations, proper tool angles, monitor height 2. Accommodate Anthropometry Accommodate different body sizes (5th-95th percentile) Adjustable equipment, multiple sizes available, reach considerations 3. Reduce Excessive Force Minimize force requirements for all tasks Mechanical assists, better handles, reduce weight, improve grip 4. Reduce Excessive Motion Reduce extreme motions, frequencies, and durations Bring work closer, eliminate unnecessary steps, use fixtures 5. Optimize Work Height Match work surface height to task requirements Precision work higher, heavy work lower, adjustable surfaces 6. Minimize Static Load Avoid holding same position for extended periods Support arms, provide seating options, allow movement 7. Environmental Conditions Optimize lighting, temperature, noise, air quality Task lighting, climate control, noise barriers, ventilation 8. Cognitive Support Design interfaces for easy understanding and use Clear displays, logical controls, consistent feedback 7.6.1 Anthropometry: Designing for Human Dimensions Anthropometry is the scientific study of human body measurements. Workstations must accommodate the range of workers who will use them. Figure 7.11: Anthropometric Design Considerations Table 7.8: Key Anthropometric Measurements for Workstation Design Measurement 5th % Female (cm) 50th % Combined (cm) 95th % Male (cm) Design Application Stature (Standing Height) 150 170 188 Overhead clearance, door height Eye Height (Standing) 138 158 176 Display/sign height Shoulder Height 121 140 158 Shelf maximum height Elbow Height 93 104 117 Work surface height (standing) Knuckle Height 64 74 85 Handle height for pulling Sitting Height 79 87 97 Overhead clearance (seated) Seated Eye Height 68 76 85 Monitor height (seated) Seated Elbow Height 18 24 31 Armrest, work surface height Thigh Clearance 12 15 19 Under-desk clearance Forward Reach 64 73 84 Maximum reach distance 7.6.2 Work Surface Height Guidelines Figure 7.12: Recommended Work Surface Heights Discussion: Why Different Heights for Different Tasks? Precision Work (100-110 cm): - Requires close visual inspection - Hands need to be at or above eye level - Examples: Electronics assembly, inspection, watchmaking Light Assembly (85-95 cm): - General manipulation tasks - Hands at about elbow height - Examples: Packaging, general assembly, sorting Heavy Work (70-85 cm): - Requires pushing, pressing, or lifting - Lower height allows use of body weight - Examples: Packing boxes, pressing operations, heavy assembly Key Principle: The work surface height should allow the worker to maintain neutral posture while performing the specific task. 7.7 Ergonomic Assessment Tools Several standardized tools help assess ergonomic risk and guide interventions. Understanding these tools is essential for the process engineer.

The seven ergonomic risk factors are: 1. Awkward Postures 2. Repetition 3. Force 4. Static Positions 5. Contact Stress 6. Vibration 7. Environmental Factors Carpal tunnel syndrome is most commonly associated with: - Repetition - Repeated wrist movements compress the median nerve - Force - Forceful gripping increases pressure in the carpal tunnel - Also contributing: awkward wrist postures and vibration Question 2: A worker performs a task 8 times per minute for a 4-hour shift. The cycle time is 7.5 seconds. Is this considered high repetition? Why? Analysis: - Cycle time: 7.5 seconds (&lt; 15 seconds threshold) - Repetitions per hour: 8 × 60 = 480 (&gt; 240 threshold) Yes, this is HIGH repetition because: 1. Cycle time is less than 15 seconds 2. Repetitions exceed 240 per hour Risk Level: High - Immediate intervention needed Recommended actions: - Job rotation with different tasks - Automation of repetitive elements - Micro-breaks every 20-30 minutes - Workstation redesign to reduce cycle elements Question 3: Explain why ergonomic design should accommodate the 5th to 95th percentile of the population rather than designing for the “average” person. Designing for the average excludes most people: - The “average” person in ALL dimensions doesn’t exist - A person may be average height but have long arms or short legs - Designing for only the 50th percentile fits only about 50% of users The 5th-95th percentile range: - Accommodates 90% of the population - Addresses both small and large users - Provides adjustability rather than fixed dimensions Application rules: - Clearances (overhead, legroom): Design for 95th percentile (largest) - Reach distances: Design for 5th percentile (smallest) - Work surfaces: Make adjustable to accommodate range Example: A fixed workstation at 95cm height: - Too high for 5th percentile female (elbow at ~93cm) - Too low for 95th percentile male (elbow at ~117cm) - Adjustable range of 85-115cm accommodates both Question 4: Calculate the NIOSH Lifting Index for the following task and determine if intervention is needed. Task Parameters: - Horizontal distance (H): 35 cm - Vertical height (V): 80 cm - Travel distance (D): 50 cm - Asymmetry (A): 0° (symmetric lift) - Frequency: 4 lifts/minute for 1 hour - Coupling: Good (handles) - Actual load: 18 kg Solution: LC = 23 kg HM = 25/35 = 0.714 VM = 1 - 0.003|80-75| = 0.985 DM = 0.82 + 4.5/50 = 0.91 AM = 1 - 0.0032(0) = 1.0 FM = 0.75 (4/min, 1 hour, V&gt;75cm, from table) CM = 1.0 (good coupling) RWL = 23 × 0.714 × 0.985 × 0.91 × 1.0 × 0.75 × 1.0 RWL = 11.0 kg LI = 18 / 11.0 = 1.64 Risk Level: MODERATE (1.0 &lt; LI &lt; 2.0) Action: Some workers may be at risk - consider changes Recommendations: - Reduce horizontal distance (bring load closer) - Reduce lifting frequency - Use mechanical assist for loads &gt;12 kg Question 5: What are three advantages of AI-powered ergonomic assessment over traditional methods? 1. Scale and Coverage: - Traditional: 5-10 assessments per day by trained ergonomist - AI: Hundreds or thousands of assessments simultaneously - Can monitor entire facility continuously 2. Consistency and Objectivity: - Traditional: Inter-rater reliability issues; different assessors may score differently - AI: Consistent scoring algorithm applied uniformly - Removes subjective interpretation 3. Real-time Feedback: - Traditional: Assessment completed, report generated days/weeks later - AI: Immediate scoring and alerts - Can provide real-time coaching to workers Additional advantages: - Lower cost per assessment - Non-disruptive (workers not aware of assessment) - Longitudinal tracking of posture patterns - Data for predictive analytics 7.14 Additional Resources 7.14.1 Videos Ergonomics Fundamentals: - Introduction to Workplace Ergonomics - Safe Manual Handling Techniques Assessment Tools: - REBA Assessment Tutorial - RULA Assessment Guide - NIOSH Lifting Equation Explained AI Ergonomics: - TuMeke AI Ergonomics Demo - VelocityEHS Industrial Ergonomics 7.14.2 Online Tools ErgoPlus REBA Calculator NIOSH Lifting Equation Calculator Cornell University Ergonomics Web 7.15 References Berlin, C., &amp; Adams, C.

Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA) is a systematic, proactive method for evaluating a manufacturing or business process to identify where and how it might fail, and to assess the relative impact of different failures. The goal is to identify and prioritize actions that will prevent defects before they occur. Figure 8.1: PFMEA: A Proactive Quality Tool 8.2.2 Brief History of FMEA Table 8.1: Evolution of FMEA Year Development Significance 1949 US Military develops FMEA (MIL-P-1629) First formal FMEA methodology 1960s NASA adopts FMEA for Apollo program Proven reliability in life-critical systems 1970s Automotive industry begins using FMEA Ford, GM, Chrysler adoption drives standardization 1980s AIAG publishes first FMEA manual Industry-wide consistency established 1990s QS-9000 requires FMEA for automotive suppliers FMEA becomes mandatory in supply chain 2000s FMEA expands to healthcare, service industries Methodology proves universal applicability 2019 AIAG-VDA FMEA Handbook published (current standard) Harmonized global standard, introduces AP method 8.2.3 DFMEA vs. PFMEA Two main types of FMEA are used in product development: Figure 8.2: DFMEA vs PFMEA: Different Focus, Same Methodology Table 8.2: DFMEA vs PFMEA Comparison Aspect DFMEA (Design) PFMEA (Process) Primary Question Will the design meet requirements? Will the process produce conforming parts? Failure Mode Example Shaft diameter too small Shaft turned undersize Effect Example Premature bearing failure Part fails incoming inspection Cause Example Inadequate stress analysis Tool wear not monitored Control Example FEA simulation, prototype testing In-process gauging, SPC Responsible Team Design engineering, R&amp;D Manufacturing, quality, production Question: When should PFMEA be conducted? Ideal Timing for PFMEA: New Process Development: Before production begins, during process design New Product Introduction: When a new product will use existing processes Process Changes: Whenever significant changes are made to equipment, methods, or materials Quality Issues: When field failures or customer complaints indicate process problems Regular Review: Periodically (annually) to ensure continued relevance Key Principle: The earlier PFMEA is conducted, the lower the cost of implementing improvements. Changes during design cost 10x less than changes during production, and 100x less than changes after customer delivery. 8.2.4 Why PFMEA Matters Figure 8.3: Benefits of PFMEA Implementation 8.3 PFMEA Fundamentals 8.3.1 Core Objectives The fundamental objective of PFMEA is prevention over detection — identifying and eliminating potential failures before they occur, rather than finding defects after production. Table 8.3: Core Objectives of PFMEA Objective Description Outcome Identify Failure Modes Systematically identify all ways the process can fail Comprehensive list of potential problems Assess Risk Evaluate severity, likelihood, and detectability of each failure Quantified risk scores (RPN or AP) Prioritize Actions Focus resources on highest-risk failure modes Action plan focused on critical issues Document Knowledge Capture institutional knowledge in a structured format Living document for continuous improvement Drive Improvement Implement and verify effectiveness of countermeasures Measurable reduction in process risk 8.3.2 The PFMEA Team PFMEA is most effective when conducted by a cross-functional team. No single person has all the knowledge needed to identify every potential failure. Figure 8.4: PFMEA Cross-Functional Team Question: Why is a cross-functional team essential? A cross-functional team is essential because: Diverse Knowledge: No single person understands all aspects of the process Different Perspectives: Quality sees defects, production sees constraints, maintenance sees failures Buy-in: People support what they help create Historical Knowledge: Operators often know about problems never formally documented System Thinking: Process interactions are visible when multiple functions participate Common Mistake: Having one engineer complete PFMEA alone as a “paperwork exercise.” This misses critical failure modes and produces an ineffective document. Best Practice: Minimum 4-6 team members, including at least one person with hands-on process experience. 8.3.3 Key Terminology Understanding PFMEA terminology is essential for effective analysis: Table 8.4: PFMEA Key Terminology Term Definition Example Process Function What the process step is supposed to do ‘Drill hole to 10mm ± 0.1mm’ Failure Mode How the process can fail to perform its function Hole diameter undersize, oversize, off-location Failure Effect The consequence of the failure on the customer or next operation Part rejected at assembly, field failure Severity (S) Rating (1-10) of how serious the failure effect is 10 = safety hazard, 1 = no effect Failure Cause Why the failure mode might occur Drill bit wear, incorrect feed rate Occurrence (O) Rating (1-10) of how likely the cause is to happen 10 = very high, 1 = remote Current Controls What currently prevents the cause or detects the failure In-process gauge, SPC chart Detection (D) Rating (1-10) of how likely current controls will detect the failure 10 = no detection, 1 = certain detection RPN Risk Priority Number = S × O × D Range: 1 to 1000 Action Priority (AP) Alternative prioritization method (AIAG-VDA) High, Medium, Low 8.3.4 The PFMEA Form The PFMEA is documented in a structured form. Here is a simplified template: Table 8.5: PFMEA Form Template (Simplified) Process Step Function Failure Mode Effect S Cause O Current Controls D RPN Action Example: Drill hole Hole undersize Assembly interference 7 Drill wear 5 Visual inspection 6 210 Add in-process gauge 8.4 The PFMEA Methodology: 10 Steps PFMEA follows a systematic 10-step methodology. Each step builds on the previous one. Figure 8.5: The 10-Step PFMEA Methodology 8.4.1 Step 1: Define Scope and Process Boundaries Before starting the analysis, clearly define what is included and excluded. Table 8.6: Step 1: Defining PFMEA Scope Element Description Example: Injection Molding Process Name Clear name identifying the process Plastic Part Injection Molding Start Boundary Where does our analysis begin? Raw material loading into hopper End Boundary Where does our analysis end? Part removed from mold, ready for packaging Included Operations All operations within scope Material prep, injection, cooling, ejection, inspection Excluded Operations Operations analyzed separately or by others Mold design (covered by DFMEA), packaging Key Assumptions Conditions assumed to be true Material meets incoming spec, mold is validated 8.4.2 Step 2: Process Mapping and Identifying Functions Create a detailed process flow diagram and identify the function of each step. Figure 8.6: Example: Injection Molding Process Flow 8.4.3 Step 3: Identifying Potential Failure Modes For each process function, ask: “How can this step fail to perform its intended function?” Table 8.7: Step 3: Identifying Failure Modes Process Function Potential Failure Mode Category Load correct material Wrong material loaded Wrong item Load correct material Material contaminated Degraded item Load correct material Insufficient material Missing item Melt to specification temperature Temperature too low Below specification Melt to specification temperature Temperature too high Above specification Fill mold completely Short shot (incomplete fill) Incomplete operation Fill mold completely Flash (overfill) Excessive operation Fill mold completely Air entrapment Unintended result Common failure mode categories: - No operation (step doesn’t happen) - Partial operation (incomplete) - Degraded operation (below standard) - Excessive operation (too much) - Wrong operation (incorrect action) - Intermittent operation (inconsistent) Interactive Exercise: Identify Failure Modes Process Step: Heat treat steel parts at 850°C for 2 hours Function: Achieve required hardness (58-62 HRC) Identify at least 5 potential failure modes: Answers: 1. Temperature too low → Parts soft (below hardness spec) 2. Temperature too high → Parts brittle/cracked 3. Time too short → Incomplete hardening 4. Time too long → Over-hardening, distortion 5. Uneven heating → Inconsistent hardness across part 6. Wrong atmosphere → Surface decarburization 7. Quench delay too long → Soft spots 8.4.4 Step 4: Analyzing Failure Effects For each failure mode, determine: “What is the consequence if this failure occurs?” Consider effects at multiple levels: 1. Local effect: Impact on immediate operation 2. Next operation effect: Impact on downstream process 3. End customer effect: Impact on final user Table 8.8: Step 4: Analyzing Effects at Multiple Levels Failure Mode Effect Level Effect Description Short shot Local Part is incomplete/missing features Short shot Next Operation Part rejected at inspection, line stoppage Short shot End Customer If shipped: product malfunction, safety hazard Flash Local Excess material on part edges Flash Next Operation Secondary trimming required, increased cycle time Flash End Customer If shipped: poor fit, appearance defect 8.4.5 Step 5: Determining Severity Ratings Severity (S) rates the seriousness of the effect on a scale of 1-10. Table 8.9: Severity Rating Scale (S) Rating Effect Criteria Example 10 Hazardous - without warning Safety hazard; noncompliance with regulations; no warning Brake failure without warning 9 Hazardous - with warning Safety hazard; noncompliance with regulations; with warning Airbag warning light before failure 8 Very High Product inoperable; loss of primary function Engine won’t start 7 High Product operable but at reduced performance Engine runs rough, reduced power 6 Moderate Product operable; comfort/convenience affected; noticeable Wind noise, A/C takes longer to cool 5 Low Product operable; reduced comfort; noticed by average customer Door handle feels loose 4 Very Low Product operable; slightly reduced comfort; noticed by discriminating customer Slight paint imperfection 3 Minor Fit/finish nonconforming; noticed by discriminating customer Panel gap slightly uneven 2 Very Minor Fit/finish nonconforming; noticed only by trained observer Under-hood label crooked 1 None No discernible effect No effect observable Important: Severity is determined by the effect, not the failure mode. Severity can only be reduced by changing the design — process changes typically cannot reduce severity. 8.4.6 Step 6: Identifying Potential Causes For each failure mode, identify all possible causes: “Why might this failure occur?” Figure 8.7: Fishbone Diagram: Causes of Short Shot 8.4.7 Step 7: Rating Occurrence Occurrence (O) rates the likelihood that the cause will occur on a scale of 1-10. Table 8.10: Occurrence Rating Scale (O) Rating Likelihood Criteria Approximate Rate Cpk Equivalent 10 Very High Failure is almost inevitable ≥100 per 1000 (≥10%) &lt; 0.33 9 Very High Failures occur very frequently 50 per 1000 (5%) ≥ 0.33 8 High Failures occur frequently 20 per 1000 (2%) ≥ 0.51 7 High Failures occur on regular basis 10 per 1000 (1%) ≥ 0.67 6 Moderate Occasional failures 5 per 1000 (0.5%) ≥ 0.83 5 Moderate Occasional failures expected 2 per 1000 (0.2%) ≥ 1.00 4 Low Relatively few failures 1 per 1000 (0.1%) ≥ 1.17 3 Low Few failures 0.5 per 1000 (500 ppm) ≥ 1.33 2 Remote Failure unlikely 0.1 per 1000 (100 ppm) ≥ 1.50 1 Remote Failure nearly impossible ≤0.01 per 1000 (≤10 ppm) ≥ 1.67 8.4.8 Step 8: Current Controls and Detection Ratings Identify current controls and rate their ability to detect the failure or cause. Types of Process Controls: Table 8.11: Types of Process Controls Control Type Purpose Examples Impact on PFMEA Prevention Controls Prevent the cause from occurring Error-proofing (poka-yoke), interlocks, maintenance programs Reduces Occurrence rating Detection Controls Detect the failure mode or cause after it occurs Inspection, testing, gauging, SPC monitoring Reduces Detection rating Detection Rating Scale: Table 8.12: Detection Rating Scale (D) Rating Detection Criteria Example Control 10 Absolute Uncertainty No current control; cannot detect or is not analyzed No inspection planned 9 Very Remote Control will probably not detect Indirect measurement only 8 Remote Control has poor chance of detection Visual inspection of hidden feature 7 Very Low Control has low chance of detection Manual 100% visual inspection 6 Low Control may detect Variable gauging after operation 5 Moderate Control has moderate chance of detection SPC charting 4 Moderately High Control has moderately high chance of detection In-station gauging with feedback 3 High Control has high chance of detection Automated 100% gauging 2 Very High Control almost certain to detect Multiple independent automated checks 1 Almost Certain Control will detect; error-proofed Error-proofing prevents defect creation Important: Detection ratings are often harder to reduce than occurrence ratings. Adding inspection doesn’t prevent defects — it only catches them. Prevention is always better than detection. Question: Why are detection ratings often harder to improve? Detection ratings are harder to reduce because: Detection doesn’t prevent: The defect has already been made; you’re just trying to find it Human inspection is unreliable: Typical effectiveness is only 80-85% for visual inspection 100% inspection is expensive: Automated inspection requires significant investment Some defects are hard to detect: Internal defects, intermittent problems, latent failures Sampling has limitations: Even good sampling plans miss some defects Better approach: Focus on reducing occurrence through: - Error-proofing (poka-yoke) - Process capability improvement - Preventive maintenance - Better training 8.4.9 Step 9: Calculating RPN and Prioritization The Risk Priority Number (RPN) combines all three ratings: \\[\\text{RPN} = \\text{Severity (S)} \\times \\text{Occurrence (O)} \\times \\text{Detection (D)}\\] # Example RPN Calculations # Failure Mode 1: Short shot S1 &lt;- 7 # Severity: Product inoperable (assembly) O1 &lt;- 5 # Occurrence: Occasional D1 &lt;- 6 # Detection: Moderate (visual inspection) RPN1 &lt;- S1 * O1 * D1 cat(&quot;Short shot RPN:&quot;, RPN1, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Short shot RPN: 210 # Failure Mode 2: Flash S2 &lt;- 4 # Severity: Appearance issue O2 &lt;- 6 # Occurrence: Regular D2 &lt;- 3 # Detection: High (easy to see) RPN2 &lt;- S2 * O2 * D2 cat(&quot;Flash RPN:&quot;, RPN2, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Flash RPN: 72 # Failure Mode 3: Contamination S3 &lt;- 9 # Severity: Safety concern (medical device) O3 &lt;- 3 # Occurrence: Low D3 &lt;- 7 # Detection: Low (internal contamination) RPN3 &lt;- S3 * O3 * D3 cat(&quot;Contamination RPN:&quot;, RPN3, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Contamination RPN: 189 # Comparison cat(&quot;\\n--- Priority Order by RPN ---\\n&quot;) ## ## --- Priority Order by RPN --- cat(&quot;1.

B: Surface scratch 3 7 2 ? C: Missing component 8 2 8 ? D: Wrong material 9 3 6 ? Answers: - A: 6 × 4 × 5 = 120 - B: 3 × 7 × 2 = 42 - C: 8 × 2 × 8 = 128 - D: 9 × 3 × 6 = 162 Priority Order: D (162) &gt; C (128) &gt; A (120) &gt; B (42) Question: Should we always address the highest RPN first? See limitations discussion below. 8.4.10 Limitations of RPN RPN has known limitations that must be understood: Figure 8.8: RPN Limitation Example Key RPN Limitations: Same RPN, different risk: 10×1×4 = 40, but 2×10×2 = 40 Severity often overlooked: High severity should always trigger action Arbitrary thresholds: Why is 100 the magic number? Non-linear scale: Difference between 2 and 3 is not same as 8 and 9 8.4.11 Action Priority (AP) Method — AIAG-VDA Alternative The 2019 AIAG-VDA FMEA Handbook introduced the Action Priority (AP) method as an alternative to RPN. Table 8.14: Action Priority (AP) Method Priority Criteria Action Required HIGH Severity = 9 or 10 (any O, any D) Must take action to improve prevention/detection HIGH Severity = 8 AND Occurrence ≥ 4 Must take action MEDIUM Severity = 7 AND Occurrence ≥ 5 Should take action MEDIUM Severity = 5-6 AND Occurrence ≥ 6 AND Detection ≥ 5 Should take action LOW All other combinations May take action; document rationale if no action 8.4.12 Step 10: Recommended Actions and Follow-Up For high-priority items, develop specific recommended actions.

Figure 8.10: PFMEA Integration with Quality Tools 8.7.1 From PFMEA to Control Plan The PFMEA directly feeds the Control Plan — a document that specifies what controls are needed at each process step. Table 8.20: PFMEA to Control Plan Linkage From PFMEA To Control Plan Process Step Operation/Step Failure Mode Characteristic to Control Severity Classification (Critical/Significant) Cause Process Parameter Current Control Control Method Detection Reaction Plan 8.8 Common Pitfalls and Best Practices 8.8.1 Common Pitfalls to Avoid Table 8.21: Common PFMEA Pitfalls and Solutions Pitfall Problem Solution Paperwork Exercise PFMEA done only to satisfy customer requirement Conduct meaningful analysis with intent to improve One-Person Show Engineer completes alone without team input Require cross-functional team participation Optimistic Detection Overestimating effectiveness of current controls Validate detection effectiveness with data Static Document Never updated after process changes Review and update after any process change RPN Obsession Focusing only on RPN numbers, missing high-severity items Also consider severity alone; use AP method Vague Failure Modes Failure modes too general to be actionable Be specific: ‘hole undersize’ not ‘bad hole’ 8.8.2 Best Practices Table 8.22: PFMEA Best Practices Practice Description Start Early Begin PFMEA during process design, not after problems occur Include Operators Operators know failures that never get documented Use Historical Data Use warranty data, scrap reports, customer complaints Be Specific Specific failure modes lead to specific actions Follow Up Verify that actions were implemented and effective Living Document Review and update regularly (minimum annually) 8.9 Case Study: Preventing a Major Quality Issue 8.9.1 Background Company: Automotive brake component manufacturer Product: Brake caliper mounting bracket Situation: New manufacturing process being implemented for a high-volume contract 8.9.2 PFMEA Analysis During the PFMEA session, the team identified a critical failure mode: Table 8.23: Case Study: Critical Failure Mode Identified Element Analysis Process Step Drill mounting holes Function Create holes at 45.0 ±0.1mm spacing Failure Mode Hole spacing out of tolerance Effect Caliper misalignment, brake performance affected Severity 9 (safety-related) Cause Fixture wear, thermal expansion Occurrence 4 (occasional) Current Control CMM check 5 per shift Detection 5 (moderate sampling) RPN 180 8.9.3 Actions Taken Based on the PFMEA, the team implemented: In-process gauging: Automated measurement after every part (D: 5 → 2) Fixture monitoring: Temperature compensation and wear tracking (O: 4 → 2) Enhanced fixture design: Carbide wear surfaces (O: 4 → 2) # Before improvements S_before &lt;- 9 O_before &lt;- 4 D_before &lt;- 5 RPN_before &lt;- S_before * O_before * D_before cat(&quot;Before RPN:&quot;, RPN_before, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Before RPN: 180 # After improvements S_after &lt;- 9 # Severity unchanged (inherent) O_after &lt;- 2 # Reduced through fixture improvements D_after &lt;- 2 # Reduced through 100% gauging RPN_after &lt;- S_after * O_after * D_after cat(&quot;After RPN:&quot;, RPN_after, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## After RPN: 36 cat(&quot;Reduction:&quot;, round((1 - RPN_after/RPN_before)*100), &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Reduction: 80 % 8.9.4 Results Zero field failures related to hole spacing after 18 months of production Estimated avoided cost: $2.4 million in potential recall and warranty Investment: $85,000 for gauging and fixture upgrades ROI: 28:1 Key Lesson: The PFMEA investment of $85,000 prevented a potential $2.4 million problem. This is the power of proactive risk management. 8.10 Summary Table 8.24: PFMEA Key Concepts Summary Topic Key Points PFMEA Purpose Prevent defects before they occur; proactive vs. reactive quality Key Ratings Severity (effect), Occurrence (likelihood), Detection (control effectiveness) RPN Calculation RPN = S × O × D; Range 1-1000; Higher = More risk Prioritization Address high RPN first, but always act on high severity (9-10) Action Priority AIAG-VDA method: High/Medium/Low based on S-O-D combination Best Practice Cross-functional team, living document, follow-up on actions 8.11 Review Questions 8.11.1 Conceptual Questions Question 1: What is the difference between a failure mode and a failure effect? Failure Mode: How the process fails to perform its intended function - Example: “Hole drilled undersize” - Example: “Temperature too low” - Example: “Missing component” Failure Effect: The consequence of the failure mode - Example: “Part rejected at assembly” (effect of undersize hole) - Example: “Product not properly cured” (effect of low temperature) - Example: “Product doesn’t function” (effect of missing component) Key Relationship: One failure mode can have multiple effects at different levels (local, downstream, customer). Question 2: Why should PFMEA be conducted by a cross-functional team? Reasons for Cross-Functional Team: Diverse expertise: No single person understands all aspects Multiple perspectives: Quality sees defects differently than production Historical knowledge: Operators know undocumented problems Buy-in: People support what they help create System thinking: Process interactions become visible Better solutions: Different functions propose different improvements Typical team composition: - Process Engineer (owner) - Quality Engineer - Production Supervisor/Operator - Maintenance Technician - Design Engineer - Supplier Representative (when applicable) Question 3: Explain why detection ratings are often harder to reduce than occurrence ratings. Detection is harder to reduce because: Detection doesn’t prevent: Defect already exists; just trying to find it Human inspection is unreliable: 80-85% effectiveness typical 100% inspection is expensive: Requires automation investment Some defects are hidden: Internal defects, intermittent failures Sampling limitations: Cannot catch all defects with sampling Better approach: Focus on occurrence reduction: - Error-proofing (poka-yoke) - Process capability improvement - Preventive maintenance - Better training Example: Reducing drill wear (occurrence) is more effective than adding more inspection (detection). Question 4: At what point in process development should PFMEA ideally be conducted? Ideal Timing: During process design, before production begins Why early is better: - Changes cost 1x during design - Changes cost 10x during production - Changes cost 100x after customer delivery PFMEA Timing Points: 1. New process development: Before equipment is ordered 2. New product introduction: During process planning 3. Process changes: Before implementing changes 4. Quality issues: When problems indicate process risk 5. Regular review: Annually at minimum Key Principle: The earlier PFMEA is conducted, the more opportunity exists to design out failures rather than inspect them out. 8.11.2 Calculation Questions Question 5: Given S=8, O=6, D=4, calculate RPN. If improved controls reduce detection to 2, what is the new RPN? Initial Calculation: RPN = S × O × D RPN = 8 × 6 × 4 = 192 After Detection Improvement: New RPN = 8 × 6 × 2 = 96 Analysis: - Original RPN: 192 (Significant risk, action required) - New RPN: 96 (Moderate risk) - Reduction: 50% Note: Severity (8) remains unchanged because it’s determined by the effect, not by process controls. Only occurrence and detection can be reduced through process improvements. Question 6: Two failure modes have RPNs of 120 and 150. Should the higher RPN always be addressed first? Answer: Not necessarily! Consider the following scenarios: Scenario A: - Failure Mode 1: RPN = 150 (S=3, O=10, D=5) — Minor cosmetic issue - Failure Mode 2: RPN = 120 (S=10, O=3, D=4) — Safety hazard Priority: Address Failure Mode 2 first despite lower RPN because: - Severity 10 indicates safety hazard - High-severity items should always be addressed regardless of RPN - The AP (Action Priority) method would classify this as HIGH priority When to prioritize lower RPN: - Higher severity (especially 9-10) - Regulatory or safety implications - Customer-critical characteristic - Easier/faster to implement Key Lesson: RPN is a prioritization tool, not the only decision criterion. Use engineering judgment. 8.11.3 Application Questions Question 7: For a metal stamping operation, identify at least five potential failure modes and their likely effects. Metal Stamping PFMEA: # Failure Mode Effect 1 Part not fully formed Dimensional rejection, functional failure 2 Burrs on edges Injury hazard, assembly interference 3 Cracks/splits Structural failure, scrap 4 Wrong material thickness Dimensional/strength issues 5 Mislocated features Assembly issues, rejection 6 Surface scratches Appearance rejection, corrosion initiation 7 Springback out of tolerance Dimensional rejection 8 Die mark/impression Appearance defect Potential Causes for “Part not fully formed”: - Insufficient press tonnage - Die wear - Material too hard - Lubrication insufficient - Press speed too fast Question 8: A process has RPN of 240 (S=8, O=6, D=5). Propose three improvement strategies and calculate resulting RPN. Current State: S=8, O=6, D=5, RPN=240 Strategy 1: Improve Detection - Add automated inspection (100% gauging) - New D = 2 - New RPN = 8 × 6 × 2 = 96 (60% reduction) Strategy 2: Improve Occurrence - Add error-proofing (poka-yoke) to prevent cause - New O = 2 - New RPN = 8 × 2 × 5 = 80 (67% reduction) Strategy 3: Combined Approach - Error-proofing (O → 3) + Better detection (D → 3) - New RPN = 8 × 3 × 3 = 72 (70% reduction) Recommendation: Strategy 2 (error-proofing) is typically preferred because: - Prevents defects from occurring - More sustainable long-term - Reduces inspection costs - Better for customer confidence 8.11.4 Critical Thinking Questions Question 9: Discuss the limitations of using RPN as the sole prioritization method. RPN Limitations: Equal weighting problem: 10×1×4 = 40 (safety hazard, rare) 2×10×2 = 40 (minor, frequent) Same RPN, very different risk! Severity often overlooked: High-severity items (9-10) should always be addressed RPN can hide safety-critical issues Non-linear scales: Difference between S=2 and S=3 is not same as S=8 and S=9 Multiplication assumes linear relationship Arbitrary thresholds: Why is RPN=100 the “action” threshold? No scientific basis for specific cutoffs Gaming the system: Teams may manipulate ratings to avoid action Subjectivity in ratings Better Approaches: - Action Priority (AP) method - Always act on S ≥ 9 regardless of RPN - Consider multiple criteria (cost, feasibility, timing) - Use risk matrix visualization Question 10: How would you handle a situation where team members disagree on severity ratings? Approach to Rating Disagreements: 1. Clarify the failure effect: - Ensure everyone understands the same effect - Be specific about which customer sees which impact 2. Reference the rating criteria: - Use the standardized scale consistently - Point to specific criteria, not opinions 3. Consider worst-case scenario: - PFMEA should consider worst reasonable case - “Could this effect happen?” vs “Will it happen?” 4. Gather data: - Review historical data if available - What have similar failures caused in the past? 5. When in doubt, go higher: - Conservative approach is appropriate for safety - Can always reduce later with evidence 6. Document the discussion: - Record the rationale for the rating - Note if there was disagreement and why decision was made 7. Get external input: - Bring in customer perspective if needed - Consult subject matter experts Final Rule: If a safety or regulatory issue is possible, severity should be 9 or 10 regardless of probability. 8.12 References AIAG &amp; VDA.

Edwards Deming 9.2 Introduction to SPC 9.2.1 What is Statistical Process Control? Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a method of quality control that uses statistical methods to monitor and control a process. It helps ensure that the process operates at its full potential to produce conforming product. Figure 9.1: The SPC Philosophy: Prevention Through Monitoring 9.2.2 Brief History of SPC Table 9.1: Evolution of Statistical Process Control Year Development Significance 1920s Walter Shewhart develops control charts at Bell Labs Birth of modern quality control 1930s-40s SPC used in WWII military production Proved effectiveness in mass production 1950s Deming teaches SPC to Japanese industry Foundation of Japanese quality revolution 1980s US automotive industry adopts SPC Response to Japanese competition 1990s SPC becomes requirement in ISO/QS-9000 Industry-wide standardization 2000s+ Real-time SPC, automated data collection Integration with Industry 4.0 9.2.3 Why SPC Matters Figure 9.2: Benefits of SPC Implementation 9.3 Understanding Variation All processes exhibit variation. No two products are ever exactly identical. The key insight of SPC is that variation comes from two fundamentally different sources, and we must respond to them differently. 9.3.1 Common Cause vs. Special Cause Variation Figure 9.3: Two Types of Variation Table 9.2: Common Cause vs. Special Cause Variation Characteristic Common Cause Variation Special Cause Variation Other Names Random, chance, noise, inherent Assignable, non-random, signal Source Built into the process; many small factors Specific, identifiable event Pattern Random, stable, predictable pattern Non-random; shifts, trends, patterns Predictability Statistically predictable within limits Unpredictable; something changed Examples Machine vibration, material variation, ambient temperature Tool breakage, new operator, bad material lot, power surge Action Required Improve the system (management decision) Find and eliminate the cause Who Acts Management — requires system change Operators/technicians — local action 9.3.2 The Two Mistakes in Process Control Understanding variation prevents two costly mistakes: Figure 9.4: The Two Fundamental Mistakes The Funnel Experiment: Why Tampering Makes Things Worse Deming’s Funnel Experiment demonstrates why adjusting a stable process increases variation: Setup: Drop a ball through a funnel onto a target. The ball lands near (but not exactly on) the target due to common cause variation. Rule 1 (Correct): Leave the funnel alone. Variation remains constant. Rule 2 (Tampering): After each drop, move the funnel to compensate for the last error. - Result: Variation DOUBLES! Rule 3 (More Tampering): Move funnel to compensate relative to the target. - Result: Variation increases without bound! Lesson: Adjusting a stable process based on individual deviations (common cause) actually makes the process worse. Only adjust when special causes are identified. Real-World Example: An operator notices a part is 0.02mm below target and adjusts the machine. The next part is 0.03mm above target (the adjustment plus normal variation). They adjust again… and the process oscillates with increasing variation. 9.3.3 When is a Process “In Control”? A process is in statistical control when: Only common cause variation is present All points fall within control limits No non-random patterns exist The process is stable and predictable Figure 9.5: In-Control vs. Out-of-Control Process 9.4 Control Charts: The Foundation of SPC 9.4.1 What is a Control Chart? A control chart is a graph that shows process data over time with statistically determined control limits. It provides a visual method for distinguishing between common and special cause variation. Figure 9.6: Anatomy of a Control Chart 9.4.2 Control Chart Components Table 9.3: Control Chart Components Component Description Purpose Center Line (CL) The process average; target for the process Shows where process is centered Upper Control Limit (UCL) Upper boundary of expected variation (+3σ) Signals if process shifted too high Lower Control Limit (LCL) Lower boundary of expected variation (-3σ) Signals if process shifted too low Data Points Individual or subgroup statistics plotted over time Visual representation of process behavior Zones A, B, C Regions between ±1σ, ±2σ, and ±3σ for pattern analysis Used for detecting trends and patterns 9.4.3 Why ±3 Sigma? Control limits are set at ±3 standard deviations from the center line. This is not arbitrary: For a normal distribution, 99.73% of data falls within ±3σ Only 0.27% (about 3 in 1000) will fall outside by chance This balances the risk of both mistakes (false alarms vs. missed signals) Figure 9.7: Normal Distribution and Control Limits 9.4.4 Choosing the Right Control Chart The type of control chart depends on the type of data being collected: Figure 9.8: Control Chart Selection Flowchart Table 9.4: Control Chart Summary Chart Type Data Type Sample Size What It Charts Typical Application X-bar / R Variable 2-9 per subgroup Subgroup mean and range Production sampling, multiple measurements X-bar / S Variable ≥10 per subgroup Subgroup mean and std dev Large subgroups, automated measurement I-MR Variable 1 (individuals) Individual values and moving range Continuous processes, expensive testing p chart Attribute Variable or constant Proportion defective Pass/fail inspection, variable sample size np chart Attribute Constant Number defective Pass/fail inspection, fixed sample size c chart Attribute Constant Number of defects Defects per item (scratches, errors) u chart Attribute Variable Defects per unit Defects per unit area or time Question: Variable vs. Attribute Data - What’s the Difference? Variable Data (Measured): - Can take any value within a range - Measured on a continuous scale - Examples: length, weight, temperature, voltage, pressure - More information per measurement - Smaller sample sizes needed Attribute Data (Counted): - Discrete categories (good/bad, pass/fail) - Counted, not measured - Examples: number of defects, number of rejects, yes/no - Less information per observation - Larger sample sizes needed When to Use Each: - Use variable data when you CAN measure (more powerful) - Use attribute data when you can only classify or count - Sometimes you convert variable to attribute (e.g., pass/fail based on tolerance) 9.5 Variable Control Charts 9.5.1 X-bar and R Chart The X-bar and R chart is the most common control chart for variable data. It tracks both the process average (X-bar) and the process spread (Range). 9.5.1.1 Constructing an X-bar/R Chart Step 1: Collect data in subgroups (typically 4-5 samples) # Example: Measuring shaft diameter (mm) # 25 subgroups of 5 measurements each set.seed(100) n_subgroups &lt;- 25 n_samples &lt;- 5 # Generate data data &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n_subgroups * n_samples, mean = 25.00, sd = 0.05), nrow = n_subgroups, ncol = n_samples) # Add a special cause (shift) at subgroup 18 data[18, ] &lt;- data[18, ] + 0.12 # Calculate statistics for each subgroup xbar &lt;- apply(data, 1, mean) R &lt;- apply(data, 1, function(x) max(x) - min(x)) cat(&quot;First 5 subgroups:\\n&quot;) ## First 5 subgroups: print(round(data[1:5, ], 4)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 24.9749 24.9781 24.9776 25.0006 24.9834 ## [2,] 25.0066 24.9640 24.9131 24.9456 25.0682 ## [3,] 24.9961 25.0115 25.0089 25.0135 24.9765 ## [4,] 25.0443 24.9421 25.0949 25.0504 25.0421 ## [5,] 25.0058 25.0124 24.8864 24.8963 24.9271 cat(&quot;\\nX-bar values:&quot;, round(xbar[1:5], 4)) ## ## X-bar values: 24.9829 24.9795 25.0013 25.0348 24.9456 cat(&quot;\\nRange values:&quot;, round(R[1:5], 4)) ## ## Range values: 0.0257 0.1551 0.037 0.1528 0.126 Step 2: Calculate control limits # Control chart constants for n=5 A2 &lt;- 0.577 D3 &lt;- 0 # D3 = 0 for n &lt; 7 D4 &lt;- 2.114 # Calculate grand mean and average range X_double_bar &lt;- mean(xbar) R_bar &lt;- mean(R) cat(&quot;Grand Mean (X-double-bar):&quot;, round(X_double_bar, 4), &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## Grand Mean (X-double-bar): 25.004 mm cat(&quot;Average Range (R-bar):&quot;, round(R_bar, 4), &quot;mm\\n\\n&quot;) ## Average Range (R-bar): 0.1023 mm # X-bar chart limits UCL_xbar &lt;- X_double_bar + A2 * R_bar LCL_xbar &lt;- X_double_bar - A2 * R_bar cat(&quot;X-bar Chart:\\n&quot;) ## X-bar Chart: cat(&quot; UCL =&quot;, round(UCL_xbar, 4), &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## UCL = 25.0631 mm cat(&quot; CL =&quot;, round(X_double_bar, 4), &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## CL = 25.004 mm cat(&quot; LCL =&quot;, round(LCL_xbar, 4), &quot;mm\\n\\n&quot;) ## LCL = 24.945 mm # R chart limits UCL_R &lt;- D4 * R_bar LCL_R &lt;- D3 * R_bar cat(&quot;R Chart:\\n&quot;) ## R Chart: cat(&quot; UCL =&quot;, round(UCL_R, 4), &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## UCL = 0.2164 mm cat(&quot; CL =&quot;, round(R_bar, 4), &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## CL = 0.1023 mm cat(&quot; LCL =&quot;, round(LCL_R, 4), &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## LCL = 0 mm Step 3: Plot the charts Figure 9.9: X-bar and R Control Charts Interpretation: Subgroup 18 shows a point above the UCL on the X-bar chart, indicating a special cause.

The Western Electric Rules identify non-random patterns: Table 9.7: Western Electric Rules for Control Chart Interpretation Rule Pattern Description What It Indicates Rule 1 Point beyond control limit One point above UCL or below LCL Sudden shift, extreme event Rule 2 Zone A: 2 of 3 consecutive points 2 out of 3 consecutive points in Zone A (&gt;2σ) or beyond, same side Process shift Rule 3 Zone B: 4 of 5 consecutive points 4 out of 5 consecutive points in Zone B (&gt;1σ) or beyond, same side Process shift Rule 4 8 consecutive points on one side 8 consecutive points above or below the center line Process shift (mean has moved) Figure 9.13: Visual Examples of Western Electric Rules 9.7.2 Additional Patterns to Watch For Table 9.8: Additional Control Chart Patterns Pattern Description Possible Causes Trend 6 or more consecutive points steadily increasing or decreasing Tool wear, temperature drift, operator fatigue Cycle Repeating high-low pattern Shift changes, batch effects, temperature cycles Stratification Points consistently near center line (too little variation) Incorrect limits, data manipulation, mixed streams Mixture Points avoiding center line (bimodal distribution) Two machines, two operators, two material lots Interactive Exercise: Identify the Out-of-Control Condition Look at this sequence of points (standardized values): 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 0.9, 1.4, 1.6, 1.3, 1.8, -0.2, 0.3 Questions: Are any points beyond ±3σ? Is there a Rule 4 violation (8 consecutive on one side)? What pattern do you see? Answers: No — all points are within ±3σ YES — Points 1-8 are all positive (above center line) This is a Rule 4 violation: 8 consecutive points above the center line indicates a likely process shift upward Action: Investigate what changed — new material lot? Different operator? Equipment adjustment? 9.8 Process Capability 9.8.1 What is Process Capability? Process capability compares the process performance to the specification limits. It answers: “Can this process consistently produce parts within tolerance?” Figure 9.14: Process Capability: Comparing Process to Specifications 9.8.2 Capability Indices Table 9.9: Process Capability Indices Index Formula What It Measures σ Estimation Cp \\(\\frac{USL - LSL}{6\\sigma}\\) Potential capability (spread only) Within-subgroup (R-bar/d2) Cpk \\(\\min\\left(\\frac{USL - \\bar{X}}{3\\sigma}, \\frac{\\bar{X} - LSL}{3\\sigma}\\right)\\) Actual capability (spread + centering) Within-subgroup (R-bar/d2) Pp \\(\\frac{USL - LSL}{6s}\\) Overall performance (spread only) Overall standard deviation (s) Ppk \\(\\min\\left(\\frac{USL - \\bar{X}}{3s}, \\frac{\\bar{X} - LSL}{3s}\\right)\\) Overall performance (spread + centering) Overall standard deviation (s) 9.8.3 Cp vs. Cpk: Why Both Matter Figure 9.15: Cp vs. Cpk: The Importance of Centering 9.8.4 Capability Example Calculation # Example: Shaft diameter specification 25.00 ± 0.15 mm # Process data from 25 subgroups of 5 USL &lt;- 25.15 LSL &lt;- 24.85 Target &lt;- 25.00 # Using earlier X-bar/R data X_bar_cap &lt;- mean(xbar) R_bar_cap &lt;- mean(R) # Estimate sigma using R-bar/d2 (d2 = 2.326 for n=5) d2 &lt;- 2.326 sigma_within &lt;- R_bar_cap / d2 cat(&quot;Process Statistics:\\n&quot;) ## Process Statistics: cat(&quot; Mean (X-bar):&quot;, round(X_bar_cap, 4), &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## Mean (X-bar): 25.004 mm cat(&quot; Sigma (estimated):&quot;, round(sigma_within, 4), &quot;mm\\n\\n&quot;) ## Sigma (estimated): 0.044 mm # Calculate Cp Cp &lt;- (USL - LSL) / (6 * sigma_within) cat(&quot;Cp =&quot;, round(Cp, 2), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Cp = 1.14 # Calculate Cpk Cpu &lt;- (USL - X_bar_cap) / (3 * sigma_within) Cpl &lt;- (X_bar_cap - LSL) / (3 * sigma_within) Cpk &lt;- min(Cpu, Cpl) cat(&quot;Cpu =&quot;, round(Cpu, 2), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Cpu = 1.11 cat(&quot;Cpl =&quot;, round(Cpl, 2), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Cpl = 1.17 cat(&quot;Cpk =&quot;, round(Cpk, 2), &quot;\\n\\n&quot;) ## Cpk = 1.11 # Interpretation cat(&quot;Interpretation:\\n&quot;) ## Interpretation: if (Cpk &gt;= 1.33) { cat(&quot;Process is CAPABLE (Cpk &gt;= 1.33)\\n&quot;) } else if (Cpk &gt;= 1.00) { cat(&quot;Process is MARGINALLY CAPABLE (1.00 &lt;= Cpk &lt; 1.33)\\n&quot;) } else { cat(&quot;Process is NOT CAPABLE (Cpk &lt; 1.00)\\n&quot;) } ## Process is MARGINALLY CAPABLE (1.00 &lt;= Cpk &lt; 1.33) 9.8.5 Capability Index Interpretation Table 9.10: Capability Index Interpretation Guide Cpk Value Sigma Level PPM Defective Interpretation Typical Industry &lt; 1.00 &lt; 3σ &gt; 2,700 Not capable — improvement required Requires immediate action 1.00 - 1.33 3σ - 4σ 2,700 - 64 Marginally capable — monitor closely Consumer products 1.33 - 1.67 4σ - 5σ 64 - 0.6 Capable — meets typical requirements General manufacturing 1.67 - 2.00 5σ - 6σ 0.6 - 0.002 Good capability — automotive/aerospace Automotive Tier 1 &gt; 2.00 &gt; 6σ &lt; 0.002 Excellent — Six Sigma level Aerospace, medical devices Question: When to use Cp/Cpk vs. Pp/Ppk? Cp/Cpk (Process Capability): - Uses within-subgroup variation (σ estimated from R-bar/d2) - Represents the POTENTIAL capability if process is in control - Use for ongoing process monitoring - Requires process to be in statistical control Pp/Ppk (Process Performance): - Uses overall standard deviation (s) of all data - Represents ACTUAL performance including all variation - Use for initial capability studies or when process stability is unknown - Includes both common and special cause variation Rule of Thumb: - If Pp ≈ Cp and Ppk ≈ Cpk → Process is stable - If Pp &lt; Cp or Ppk &lt; Cpk → Process has special cause variation (not in control) 9.9 Responding to Out-of-Control Signals 9.9.1 The Response Process Figure 9.16: Responding to Out-of-Control Conditions 9.9.2 Investigation Checklist (5 Ms + E) Table 9.11: Investigation Checklist: 5 Ms + E Category Questions to Ask Man Different operator?

Contamination? 9.10 SPC Implementation 9.10.1 Steps to Implement SPC Table 9.12: SPC Implementation Steps Step Action Key Considerations 1 Select the process and characteristic Start with critical/problem processes 2 Determine measurement system adequacy (MSA) Gauge R&amp;R must be acceptable (&lt; 30%) 3 Collect initial data (25+ subgroups) Process must be running normally 4 Calculate trial control limits Limits based on actual process, not specs 5 Identify and remove special causes Investigate each out-of-control point 6 Recalculate limits with stable data These become the standard limits 7 Implement ongoing monitoring Train operators, establish reaction plans 8 Review and improve continuously Update limits when process improves 9.10.2 Common SPC Mistakes Table 9.13: Common SPC Mistakes and Corrections Mistake Why It’s Wrong Correct Approach Using specification limits as control limits Control limits are based on process performance, not specs Calculate limits from process data (mean ± 3σ) Changing limits too frequently Limits should only change when process fundamentally changes Use stable baseline; recalculate only after sustained improvement Ignoring the R chart R chart often signals problems before X-bar chart Always analyze R chart first — variation stability Over-adjusting (tampering) Adjusting for common cause variation increases variation Only adjust when special cause is identified Not acting on signals Defeats the purpose of SPC Investigate and act on every out-of-control signal 9.11 Summary Table 9.14: SPC Key Concepts Summary Topic Key Points Variation Common cause (inherent) vs. special cause (assignable); respond differently Control Charts Graph with UCL/LCL at ±3σ; distinguishes between variation types Variable Charts X-bar/R (n=2-9), X-bar/S (n≥10), I-MR (n=1) Attribute Charts p (proportion), np (count defectives), c (defects), u (defects/unit) Interpretation Western Electric rules: beyond limits, 2 of 3 in Zone A, 4 of 5 in Zone B, 8 consecutive Capability Cp (potential), Cpk (actual); ≥1.33 is capable; ≥1.67 for automotive 9.12 Review Questions 9.12.1 Conceptual Questions Question 1: What is the difference between common cause and special cause variation? Common Cause Variation: - Inherent to the process - Always present - Random and predictable - Many small factors - System-level improvement required - Examples: machine vibration, material variation, ambient temperature Special Cause Variation: - External to normal process - Intermittent or new - Non-random patterns - Specific assignable cause - Local action to eliminate - Examples: tool breakage, new operator, bad material lot Key Point: Only act on special causes. Attempting to adjust for common cause variation (tampering) makes the process worse. Question 2: Why are control limits set at ±3 sigma rather than ±2 sigma? At ±3σ: - 99.73% of data falls within limits (when in control) - Only 0.27% false alarm rate (about 3 per 1000 points) - Good balance between detecting real problems and avoiding false alarms If we used ±2σ: - 95.45% of data within limits - 4.55% false alarm rate (about 45 per 1000 points!) - Too many false alarms → operators ignore the chart If we used ±4σ: - 99.99% within limits - Almost no false alarms - But we’d miss real problems (low sensitivity) The ±3σ choice balances: - Risk of false alarm (treating common cause as special) - Risk of missed signal (treating special cause as common) Question 3: When would you use an I-MR chart instead of an X-bar/R chart? Use I-MR Chart When: Sample size is n = 1 — only one measurement per time period Destructive testing — can’t afford multiple samples Expensive measurement — time or cost prohibitive Continuous process — each reading is independent (batch process) Long intervals — measurements far apart in time Homogeneous batches — within-batch variation is negligible Examples: - Daily chemical batch analysis - Weekly calibration check - Each lot incoming inspection (one sample per lot) - Continuous process temperature readings Caution: I-MR charts are less sensitive than X-bar charts because averaging in subgroups reduces noise. 9.12.2 Calculation Questions Question 4: Calculate control limits for an X-bar/R chart given the following data. Given: - 20 subgroups of n = 4 measurements - Grand mean (X-double-bar) = 50.25 - Average range (R-bar) = 2.40 - Constants for n = 4: A2 = 0.729, D3 = 0, D4 = 2.282 Calculate UCL and LCL for both charts. Solution: X-bar Chart: UCL = X-double-bar + A2 × R-bar UCL = 50.25 + 0.729 × 2.40 = 50.25 + 1.75 = 52.00 LCL = X-double-bar - A2 × R-bar LCL = 50.25 - 0.729 × 2.40 = 50.25 - 1.75 = 48.50 CL = 50.25 R Chart: UCL = D4 × R-bar = 2.282 × 2.40 = 5.48 LCL = D3 × R-bar = 0 × 2.40 = 0 CL = 2.40 Question 5: Calculate Cp and Cpk for a process with the following data. Given: - Specification: 100 ± 5 (USL = 105, LSL = 95) - Process mean = 102 - Process standard deviation (σ) = 1.5 Solution: Cp (Potential Capability): Cp = (USL - LSL) / (6σ) Cp = (105 - 95) / (6 × 1.5) Cp = 10 / 9 = 1.11 Cpk (Actual Capability): Cpu = (USL - X-bar) / (3σ) = (105 - 102) / (3 × 1.5) = 3 / 4.5 = 0.67 Cpl = (X-bar - LSL) / (3σ) = (102 - 95) / (3 × 1.5) = 7 / 4.5 = 1.56 Cpk = min(Cpu, Cpl) = min(0.67, 1.56) = 0.67 Interpretation: - Cp = 1.11 suggests process spread could fit within specs IF centered - Cpk = 0.67 shows process is NOT capable because it’s shifted toward USL - Action: Center the process closer to 100 (target) Question 6: A p chart has p-bar = 0.04 and sample size n = 200. Calculate control limits. Solution: Center Line: CL = p-bar = 0.04 (4% defective) Upper Control Limit: UCL = p-bar + 3 × √(p-bar × (1 - p-bar) / n) UCL = 0.04 + 3 × √(0.04 × 0.96 / 200) UCL = 0.04 + 3 × √(0.000192) UCL = 0.04 + 3 × 0.01386 UCL = 0.04 + 0.0416 = 0.0816 (8.16%) Lower Control Limit: LCL = p-bar - 3 × √(p-bar × (1 - p-bar) / n) LCL = 0.04 - 0.0416 = -0.0016 Since LCL cannot be negative: LCL = 0 Final Limits: - UCL = 8.16% - CL = 4.00% - LCL = 0% 9.12.3 Application Questions Question 7: You observe 8 consecutive points above the center line but all within control limits. What does this indicate? This is a Rule 4 violation (Western Electric Rules). What it indicates: - The process mean has shifted upward - This is a SPECIAL CAUSE signal - Even though no points are beyond limits, the pattern is not random Probability analysis: - Probability of a point above CL (random) = 0.5 - Probability of 8 consecutive above CL = 0.5^8 = 0.0039 (0.39%) - This is very unlikely by chance alone Action required: 1. Stop and mark the chart 2. Investigate what changed around the time of the first high point 3. Check: new material lot? Tool change? Operator change? Temperature? 4. Correct the cause 5. Monitor to verify process returns to normal Question 8: A process has Cp = 2.0 but Cpk = 1.0. What does this tell you? Analysis: Cp = 2.0 means: - Process spread (6σ) is half the specification width - The process COULD produce no defects if centered - Potential capability is excellent Cpk = 1.0 means: - Process is off-center - Actual capability is only marginal - Some defects are being produced The difference (Cp - Cpk = 1.0) indicates: - The process mean is shifted 3σ from the target - One side has much less margin than the other Visual: LSL Target USL | | | [====PROCESS====] ↑ shifted to one side Action: - Center the process on target - After centering, Cpk should approach Cp (both ≈ 2.0) - This is an adjustment action, not a variation reduction Question 9: Why should you always analyze the R chart before the X-bar chart? The R chart should be analyzed first because: Control limits depend on variation: X-bar limits are calculated using R-bar If R is out of control, X-bar limits are unreliable R chart is more sensitive to variation changes: Tool wear shows on R chart before X-bar Inconsistent setup appears as increased R Process must be stable in variation first: A process can’t be “in control” if variation is changing Stable variation is a prerequisite for evaluating the mean Different actions for each: R chart problem → variation issue (consistency) X-bar problem → centering issue (average) Rule: If R chart is out of control, fix that FIRST before interpreting the X-bar chart. 9.13 References Montgomery, D.C.

Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is a holistic approach to equipment maintenance that strives to achieve perfect production with no breakdowns, no defects, and no accidents. It involves everyone in the organization, from operators to top management. Figure 10.1: The TPM Philosophy 10.2.2 History of TPM Table 10.1: Evolution of Maintenance Philosophy Era Maintenance Approach Description Key Change Pre-1950s Breakdown Maintenance Fix it when it breaks; reactive only No prevention 1950s Preventive Maintenance Scheduled maintenance to prevent failures Time-based prevention 1960s Productive Maintenance Maintenance focused on reliability and maintainability Design for maintenance 1970s TPM Developed Nakajima develops TPM at Nippondenso (Toyota supplier) Operator involvement 1980s TPM Spreads Globally Adopted by automotive, electronics, process industries worldwide World-class standard 1990s-Present TPM + Industry 4.0 Integration with predictive analytics, IoT sensors, AI Data-driven maintenance 10.2.3 The Goals of TPM TPM aims to achieve zero targets: Figure 10.2: TPM Zero Targets 10.2.4 Traditional vs. TPM Approach Table 10.2: Traditional Maintenance vs. TPM Aspect Traditional Maintenance TPM Approach Equipment ownership ‘Maintenance owns the machines’ ‘We all own the machines’ Maintenance responsibility Maintenance department only Everyone (operators + maintenance) Operator role Operate; call maintenance when broken Operate, clean, inspect, maintain Maintenance focus Fix breakdowns quickly Prevent breakdowns; extend life Problem solving Reactive; fire-fighting Proactive; root cause elimination Goal Minimize maintenance cost Maximize equipment effectiveness Question: Why involve operators in maintenance? Operators are the first line of defense because: They know the equipment: Operators work with machines every day and notice subtle changes Early detection: Small problems are detected before becoming major failures Ownership mindset: People take better care of things they “own” Reduced response time: Operators can address minor issues immediately Freed maintenance resources: Technicians can focus on complex tasks Example: An operator notices a slight vibration change in a motor. Under traditional maintenance, they might ignore it. Under TPM, they report it, potentially preventing a $50,000 breakdown. “No one knows a machine better than the person who operates it every day.” 10.3 The Eight Pillars of TPM TPM is built on eight pillars, each addressing a specific aspect of equipment management and organizational culture. Figure 10.3: The Eight Pillars of TPM Table 10.3: The Eight Pillars of TPM # Pillar Purpose Key Activities 1 Autonomous Maintenance Operators maintain their own equipment Cleaning, inspection, lubrication, minor repairs 2 Planned Maintenance Scheduled maintenance by specialists PM schedules, predictive maintenance, spare parts 3 Quality Maintenance Zero defects through equipment conditions Identify equipment conditions causing defects 4 Focused Improvement Eliminate losses through kaizen activities Loss analysis, root cause, countermeasures 5 Early Equipment Management Design equipment for maintainability Design reviews, vertical startup, LCC analysis 6 Training &amp; Education Develop skilled operators and technicians Skills matrix, training programs, OJT 7 Safety, Health, Environment Zero accidents, safe workplace Hazard identification, safety audits, ergonomics 8 TPM in Office Apply TPM principles to administrative processes Streamline workflows, reduce waste in offices 10.4 Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) 10.4.1 What is OEE? Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is the primary metric of TPM. It measures how effectively equipment is being used by combining three factors: Availability, Performance, and Quality.

The biggest opportunity is in Performance (speed losses). 10.5 The Six Big Losses TPM categorizes all equipment losses into six categories, which map directly to the OEE components. Figure 10.6: The Six Big Losses Table 10.6: The Six Big Losses Explained # Loss Category OEE Component Description Examples 1 Equipment Failure Availability Unplanned equipment breakdown Motor failure, sensor malfunction, mechanical breakdown 2 Setup &amp; Adjustment Availability Time for changeover, tool changes, adjustments Die change, product changeover, calibration 3 Idling &amp; Minor Stops Performance Brief stoppages (jams, blockages, cleaning) Sensor trips, material jams, overloads (&lt;5 min) 4 Reduced Speed Performance Running slower than design speed Worn tooling, operator caution, material variability 5 Process Defects Quality Defects produced during normal operation Scrap, rework, out-of-spec product 6 Startup Rejects Quality Defects during warmup, startup, changeover First-off rejects, warming up, stabilization 10.5.1 Typical Loss Distribution Figure 10.7: Typical Distribution of the Six Big Losses 10.6 Autonomous Maintenance Autonomous Maintenance (AM) is the first and most visible pillar of TPM. It transfers basic maintenance tasks from maintenance specialists to operators. 10.6.1 The Seven Steps of Autonomous Maintenance Figure 10.8: Seven Steps of Autonomous Maintenance Table 10.7: Autonomous Maintenance Steps in Detail Step Name Activities Outcome 1 Initial Cleaning Deep clean equipment; identify abnormalities Equipment baseline; 100+ abnormalities found typical 2 Eliminate Contamination Sources Find and fix sources of dirt, leaks, contamination Reduced cleaning time; contamination controlled 3 Cleaning &amp; Lubrication Standards Create standards for cleaning, lubricating, inspection Consistent equipment condition; clear expectations 4 General Inspection Train operators on equipment function; expand skills Skilled operators; detect abnormalities early 5 Autonomous Inspection Operators perform scheduled inspections independently Reliable self-directed maintenance program 6 Organization &amp; Tidiness Standardize workplace; visual management Efficient, safe, visual workplace 7 Full Autonomous Maintenance Continuous improvement; operators propose improvements Empowered operators; sustained improvement 10.6.2 The AM Tag System During autonomous maintenance activities, operators identify abnormalities using tags: Figure 10.9: AM Tag System 10.6.3 Example: AM Cleaning and Inspection Checklist Table 10.8: Sample AM Inspection Checklist # Check Item Method Standard Frequency 1 General cleanliness Visual No dust, debris, contamination Daily 2 Oil/lubricant levels Visual/gauge Between min-max marks Daily 3 Loose bolts/fasteners Touch/wrench Hand tight + 1/4 turn Weekly 4 Unusual sounds Listen Normal operating sound Each startup 5 Vibration Touch Minimal, no unusual patterns Each startup 6 Temperature Touch/thermometer &lt; 60°C (or per spec) Hourly 7 Leaks (oil, air, coolant) Visual No visible leaks Daily 8 Safety guards in place Visual All guards secure Each shift 10.7 Planned Maintenance Planned Maintenance is the second pillar, focusing on scheduled maintenance activities performed by maintenance specialists. 10.7.1 Types of Maintenance Figure 10.10: Types of Maintenance Activities Table 10.9: Maintenance Strategy Comparison Type Approach Advantages Disadvantages Best For Breakdown Run to failure No upfront cost Unplanned downtime, secondary damage Non-critical, cheap to replace Preventive Time/cycle-based replacement Planned downtime, parts availability May replace good parts Wear items with known life Predictive Condition monitoring Optimal component life, targeted actions Monitoring investment required Critical equipment, expensive failures Proactive Root cause elimination Prevents future failures Requires analysis capability Recurring problems 10.7.2 Predictive Maintenance Technologies Table 10.10: Predictive Maintenance Technologies Technology What It Detects Equipment Applications Typical Warning Time Vibration Analysis Imbalance, misalignment, bearing wear, looseness Rotating equipment (motors, pumps, fans, gearboxes) Weeks to months Thermography Hot spots, electrical issues, friction, insulation problems Electrical panels, motors, bearings, refractory Hours to days Oil Analysis Contamination, wear particles, lubricant degradation Gearboxes, hydraulics, engines, compressors Weeks to months Ultrasound Leaks, bearing defects, electrical discharge Steam traps, valves, bearings, electrical equipment Days to weeks Motor Current Analysis Motor winding issues, rotor bar problems, power quality Electric motors, drives, generators Days to weeks 10.7.3 The P-F Curve The P-F Curve illustrates the concept of detecting potential failure (P) before functional failure (F). ## Warning in geom_point(aes(x = 4, y = 75), size = 5, color = &quot;#F39C12&quot;): All aesthetics have length 1, but ## the data has 101 rows. ## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` ## or provide this layer with data ## containing a single row. ## Warning in geom_point(aes(x = 9, y = 10), size = 5, color = &quot;#E74C3C&quot;): All aesthetics have length 1, but ## the data has 101 rows. ## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` ## or provide this layer with data ## containing a single row.

Preventive Maintenance (Time-Based): - Replaces parts at fixed intervals regardless of condition - May replace parts still in good condition (waste) - May miss failures that occur before scheduled replacement - Based on average life, not individual component condition Predictive Maintenance (Condition-Based): - Monitors actual equipment condition - Replaces parts when condition indicates need - Maximizes component life - Provides warning time to plan repairs Example: - Preventive: Replace bearing every 6 months (may last 9 months or fail at 4 months) - Predictive: Monitor vibration; replace when trending indicates 2-3 weeks to failure - Result: Optimal component life, planned downtime, no unexpected failures Cost Comparison: - Reactive repair: $10,000 (including secondary damage, lost production) - Preventive replacement: $3,000 (may waste $1,000 in parts life) - Predictive replacement: $2,500 (optimal timing, minimal waste) 10.8 Focused Improvement (Kobetsu Kaizen) Focused Improvement uses cross-functional teams to eliminate specific losses identified through OEE analysis. 10.8.1 The Kaizen Process Figure 10.12: Focused Improvement Process 10.8.2 Loss Elimination Tools Table 10.11: Tools for Loss Elimination Tool Purpose Application Pareto Analysis Identify biggest losses to target Prioritize improvement efforts Why-Why Analysis Find root cause of failures Breakdown analysis, defect investigation PM Analysis Analyze chronic losses systematically Complex, recurring problems SMED Reduce setup/changeover time Availability improvement (Loss #2) Poka-Yoke Error-proof the process Quality improvement (Losses #5, #6) 10.9 TPM Implementation 10.9.1 The 12 Steps of TPM Implementation Table 10.12: 12 Steps of TPM Implementation Phase Step Activity Duration Preparation 1 Announce TPM introduction by top management 1 month Preparation 2 Education and campaign to introduce TPM 3-6 months Preparation 3 Create TPM promotion organization 1-2 months Preparation 4 Establish basic TPM policies and goals 1-2 months Preparation 5 Formulate master plan for TPM development 1-2 months Implementation 6 Hold TPM kick-off 1 day Implementation 7 Improve effectiveness of each piece of equipment 6-12 months Implementation 8 Develop autonomous maintenance program 12-24 months Implementation 9 Develop planned maintenance program 12-24 months Implementation 10 Conduct training to improve skills Ongoing Stabilization 11 Develop early equipment management program 12-24 months Stabilization 12 Perfect TPM implementation and raise levels Ongoing 10.9.2 Success Factors Table 10.13: TPM Success Factors Factor Why Critical Top Management Commitment Resources, culture change, sustained focus Training and Education Skills to identify problems, perform maintenance Small Group Activities Operator involvement, team problem-solving Visual Management Make abnormalities obvious, track progress Patience and Persistence TPM takes 3-5 years to fully implement 10.10 Case Study: TPM Implementation 10.10.1 Background Company: Automotive component manufacturer Equipment: CNC machining center Initial OEE: 52% 10.10.2 Problem Analysis # Initial State cat(&quot;=== INITIAL OEE BREAKDOWN ===\\n\\n&quot;) ## === INITIAL OEE BREAKDOWN === availability_initial &lt;- 78 # % performance_initial &lt;- 82 # % quality_initial &lt;- 81 # % oee_initial &lt;- (availability_initial/100) * (performance_initial/100) * (quality_initial/100) * 100 cat(&quot;Availability:&quot;, availability_initial, &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Availability: 78 % cat(&quot;Performance:&quot;, performance_initial, &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Performance: 82 % cat(&quot;Quality:&quot;, quality_initial, &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Quality: 81 % cat(&quot;OEE:&quot;, round(oee_initial, 1), &quot;%\\n\\n&quot;) ## OEE: 51.8 % # Loss breakdown cat(&quot;=== TOP LOSSES IDENTIFIED ===\\n&quot;) ## === TOP LOSSES IDENTIFIED === cat(&quot;1.

Question 2: Why is OEE calculated as a product rather than a sum? OEE uses multiplication because losses are sequential and compound: Availability determines how much time is available Performance determines how much of that time is productive Quality determines how much of that production is good Example: - If each factor is 90%: OEE = 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 72.9% (not 270% or 90%) - This reflects reality: you can only achieve quality on parts that were produced (performance) during time the machine ran (availability) Why this matters: - Small improvements in all three factors compound - 5% improvement in each: 0.85 × 0.85 × 0.85 = 61% → 0.90 × 0.90 × 0.90 = 73% - Focus on the weakest factor first for biggest impact Question 3: What is the difference between autonomous maintenance and planned maintenance? Aspect Autonomous Maintenance Planned Maintenance Who Operators Maintenance technicians What Basic care (clean, inspect, lubricate) Complex repairs, overhauls When Daily, during operation Scheduled intervals Skills Basic equipment knowledge Technical expertise Goal Prevent deterioration Restore/improve equipment They complement each other: - AM catches problems early (first line of defense) - PM provides specialized skills when needed - Together they achieve zero breakdowns 10.12.2 Calculation Questions Question 4: Calculate OEE given the following data. Given: - Shift length: 480 minutes - Breaks: 30 minutes - Changeover: 45 minutes - Breakdown: 20 minutes - Ideal cycle time: 30 seconds (0.5 min) - Total parts produced: 580 - Rejected parts: 23 Solution: Planned Production Time = 480 - 30 = 450 minutes Run Time = 450 - 45 - 20 = 385 minutes Availability = 385 / 450 = 85.6% Theoretical Output = 385 / 0.5 = 770 parts Performance = 580 / 770 = 75.3% Quality = (580 - 23) / 580 = 557 / 580 = 96.0% OEE = 85.6% × 75.3% × 96.0% = 61.9% Analysis: Performance is the biggest opportunity for improvement (75.3% vs. targets of 95%). Investigate minor stops and speed losses. Question 5: A machine has OEE of 65% with Availability 90%, Performance 80%, Quality 90%. Which factor should be prioritized? Analysis: Current state: - Availability: 90% (Gap to world class: 5%) - Performance: 80% (Gap to world class: 15%) - Quality: 90% (Gap to world class: 9%) Performance should be prioritized because: Biggest gap: 15 percentage points below world class (95%) Biggest OEE impact: Improving performance 10% → OEE = 90% × 90% × 90% = 72.9% Often overlooked: Speed losses and minor stops are frequently accepted as normal Investigation areas for performance: - Minor stops (jams, blockages, sensor trips) - Reduced speed operation - Idling and waiting - Operator pace Question 6: If current OEE is 60% and target is 85%, what improvement is needed in each component assuming equal improvement? Solution: Current: 60% = A × P × Q If we improve each equally, we need: - Target: 85% = A’ × P’ × Q’ - If A’ = P’ = Q’ = x, then x³ = 0.85 - x = ∛0.85 = 0.947 = 94.7% Each component needs to reach approximately 95% Check: 0.947 × 0.947 × 0.947 = 0.849 ≈ 85% If current factors are A=80%, P=85%, Q=88%: - Availability needs: +15 points (80% → 95%) - Performance needs: +10 points (85% → 95%) - Quality needs: +7 points (88% → 95%) Prioritize by gap size: Availability first, then Performance, then Quality. 10.12.3 Application Questions Question 7: An operator notices a small oil leak on a machine. Under traditional maintenance vs. TPM, what happens? Traditional Maintenance Approach: 1. Operator continues running machine 2. May or may not report to maintenance 3. If reported, added to backlog 4. Maintenance addresses when convenient (days/weeks) 5. Leak worsens, potential bearing damage 6. Eventually leads to breakdown TPM Approach: 1. Operator notices during routine inspection 2. Tags the abnormality immediately 3. Determines if operator can fix (blue tag) or needs maintenance (red tag) 4. If simple: operator tightens fitting or adds sealant 5. If complex: maintenance prioritizes based on severity 6. Root cause investigated to prevent recurrence 7. Finding shared in team meeting Key Differences: - Ownership: Operator takes responsibility vs. “not my job” - Speed: Immediate action vs. delayed response - Prevention: Fixed before failure vs. reactive repair - Cost: $10 seal vs. $5,000 bearing replacement + downtime Question 8: List five items an operator should check during daily autonomous maintenance. Five Essential Daily AM Checks: Cleanliness: Remove chips, debris, dust; clean safety windows and sensors Why: Contamination causes wear, sensor malfunctions, quality issues Lubrication: Check oil levels, grease points, coolant level Why: Inadequate lubrication causes friction, heat, accelerated wear Fasteners: Check for loose bolts, guards, covers Why: Loose fasteners cause vibration, safety hazards, misalignment Leaks: Look for oil, coolant, air, hydraulic leaks Why: Leaks indicate seal failure, waste resources, create hazards Abnormal sounds/vibration: Listen and feel during startup Why: Changes indicate developing problems (bearings, alignment) Bonus items: - Safety guards in place - Emergency stops functional - Pressure/temperature gauges in normal range - No unusual smells (burning, chemical) Question 9: Explain how SMED relates to OEE improvement. SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Die) directly improves Availability: Loss #2: Setup and Adjustment is an availability loss captured in OEE. How SMED helps: Reduces changeover time: Before SMED: 45-minute changeover After SMED: 10-minute changeover Gain: 35 minutes per changeover Impact on OEE: If 2 changeovers per shift: 70 minutes saved On 450-minute shift: Availability improves 15%+ Secondary benefits: More changeovers become practical Smaller batch sizes possible Flexibility increased Less WIP inventory SMED Process: 1. Separate internal (machine stopped) from external (while running) setup 2. Convert internal to external where possible 3. Streamline remaining internal operations 4. Practice and standardize Example: Die change on press - External: Stage next die, prepare tools, preheat - Internal: Remove old die, install new die, adjust - Target: All possible work done while machine runs 10.13 References Nakajima, S.

For electromechanical technicians, effective troubleshooting is perhaps the most valuable skill you can develop. 11.2.1 The Cost of Downtime Equipment failures and process problems have significant financial impacts: 11.2.2 Reactive vs. Proactive Problem Solving Table 11.1: Table 11.2: Comparison of Problem-Solving Approaches Aspect Reactive Approach Proactive Approach Timing After failure occurs Before or early in failure Focus Quick fix to restore operation Root cause elimination Stress Level High - production pressure Lower - planned approach Cost High - emergency repairs Lower - scheduled work Learning Limited - rush to fix High - thorough analysis Documentation Often skipped Systematic and complete Think About It: Why do organizations often default to reactive troubleshooting? Common reasons include: - Time pressure: Production demands make it tempting to apply quick fixes - Lack of training: Technicians may not know RCA methodologies - Reward systems: Organizations may reward “firefighters” who quickly restore production - Missing data: Without good records, patterns are hard to identify - Culture: “We’ve always done it this way” mentality The irony is that reactive troubleshooting actually costs more time in the long run due to recurring problems. 11.3 Systematic Troubleshooting Methodology Effective troubleshooting follows a structured approach rather than random trial-and-error. 11.3.1 The DMAIC Troubleshooting Framework 11.3.2 Step 1: Define the Problem A well-defined problem is half-solved. Use the 5W2H method: Table 11.3: Table 11.4: 5W2H Problem Definition Framework Question What to Ask Example Response WHAT What is the problem? What is happening vs. what should happen? Motor overheating on conveyor line 3 WHERE Where does the problem occur? Location, machine, station? Discharge end of conveyor, motor housing WHEN When did it start? When does it occur? Continuous or intermittent? Started Monday, occurs after 2 hours of operation WHO Who discovered it? Who is affected? Who was operating? Operator noticed, maintenance called, affects packaging dept WHY Why is this a problem? What is the impact? Risk of motor failure, line stoppage, safety hazard HOW How was the problem detected? How is it manifesting? Detected by high-temp alarm at 85°C HOW MUCH How often? How many units affected? What is the magnitude? Occurs every day, 100% of shifts, 15°C above normal 11.3.3 Problem Statement Template Good Problem Statement Format: “[WHAT] is occurring at [WHERE] since [WHEN], affecting [WHO/WHAT], with a magnitude of [HOW MUCH].” Example: &gt; “Motor overheating (85°C vs. normal 70°C) is occurring at Conveyor Line 3 discharge motor since Monday morning, affecting packaging department production, with the condition occurring every shift after approximately 2 hours of operation.” Practice: Write a problem statement for this scenario Scenario: An injection molding machine is producing parts with short shots (incomplete fill). The problem was noticed by the quality inspector during the night shift. About 15% of parts are affected. The issue seems worse when running the larger 500g parts compared to the smaller 200g parts. Sample Problem Statement: “Short shots (incomplete cavity fill) are occurring on Injection Molding Machine #4 since night shift on Tuesday, affecting 15% of parts produced, with the defect rate increasing significantly when running 500g parts compared to 200g parts.” 11.3.4 Step 2: Gather Data and Observations Before making any changes, collect information systematically: Table 11.5: Table 11.6: Systematic Data Gathering Checklist Data Source What to Check Tools/Methods Visual Inspection Physical condition, wear, contamination, alignment, damage Flashlight, mirror, magnifier, camera Operator Interview What changed? When did it start? Any unusual events? Open-ended questions, active listening Machine Parameters Temperatures, pressures, speeds, currents, positions HMI screens, gauges, multimeter, thermal camera Historical Records Maintenance logs, previous repairs, similar issues CMMS, logbooks, work orders Product/Output Defect patterns, measurements, reject rates Calipers, gauges, CMM, visual inspection Environmental Temperature, humidity, vibration, power quality Thermometer, hygrometer, vibration analyzer 11.3.5 The “Change Analysis” Approach Many problems are caused by changes. Ask: What changed recently? New materials, suppliers, or batches? New operators or different shifts? Maintenance performed? Environmental changes (weather, season)? Software updates or parameter changes? New products or recipes running? 11.4 Understanding Root Cause vs. Symptoms A critical concept in troubleshooting is distinguishing between different levels of causation. 11.4.1 The Causation Hierarchy 11.4.2 Why Finding Root Cause Matters Table 11.7: Table 11.8: Comparison of Fixes at Different Causation Levels Fix Level Action Taken Immediate Result Recurrence Short-term Cost Long-term Cost Symptom Add cooling fan to motor Motor runs cooler temporarily Problem returns in days $50 $5000+ (repeated failures) Immediate Cause Replace worn bearing Motor works for a while Problem returns in months $200 $2400 (annual replacements) Root Cause Implement PM schedule with lubrication tasks Problem eliminated permanently Problem does not recur $500 $500 (one-time implementation) 11.5 The 5 Whys Technique The 5 Whys is a simple but powerful technique developed by Sakichi Toyoda and used within Toyota’s manufacturing methods. 11.5.1 How It Works State the problem Ask “Why?” to identify the cause Ask “Why?” again about that cause Continue asking “Why?” until you reach the root cause Typically requires 5 iterations (sometimes more, sometimes less) 11.5.2 5 Whys Example: Production Line Stoppage 11.5.3 5 Whys Template Table 11.9: Table 11.10: 5 Whys Analysis Template Step Description Typical Cause Type Problem Statement Clear, specific description of what happened Symptom Why #1 First-level cause (usually technical/physical) Physical Why #2 Why did that first cause occur? Physical/Human Why #3 Why did the second cause occur? Human/Process Why #4 Why did the third cause occur? Process/System Why #5 Why did the fourth cause occur? System/Culture Root Cause The fundamental cause that, if fixed, prevents recurrence Root 11.5.4 Multiple Branches in 5 Whys Sometimes a problem has multiple causes. When you encounter this, branch your analysis: Practice Exercise: Perform a 5 Whys Analysis Scenario: A CNC machine produced 50 parts that were all 0.5mm undersize on a critical diameter. Try to complete the 5 Whys analysis before looking at the sample answer below. Sample Analysis: Problem: CNC produced 50 undersize parts Why #1: The tool offset was set incorrectly Why #2: The operator entered the wrong offset value Why #3: The operator misread the setup sheet Why #4: The setup sheet had poor formatting and small print Why #5: No standard format exists for setup documentation Root Cause: Lack of standardized, clear setup documentation Corrective Actions: - Create standardized setup sheet template with large, clear fonts - Add visual verification step (photo of correct setup) - Implement first-piece inspection requirement before production run 11.6 Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram The Ishikawa diagram, also called a fishbone diagram or cause-and-effect diagram, was developed by Kaoru Ishikawa in the 1960s. It provides a structured way to brainstorm and categorize potential causes. 11.6.1 The 6M Categories Manufacturing problems are typically organized using the 6M categories: 11.6.2 Constructing a Fishbone Diagram ## Warning in geom_segment(data = spine, aes(x = x[1], y = y[1], xend = x[2], : All aesthetics have length 1, but ## the data has 2 rows. ## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` ## or provide this layer with data ## containing a single row. 11.6.3 Fishbone Diagram Best Practices Table 11.11: Table 11.12: Best Practices for Fishbone Diagram Development Guideline Description Team Approach Include operators, engineers, maintenance, quality - diverse perspectives No Evaluation During Brainstorming Capture all ideas first; evaluate feasibility later Use Specific Language Not ‘machine problem’ but ‘bearing wear on spindle motor’ Aim for 3-5 Causes per Category Some categories may have more; don’t force causes into categories Circle the Most Likely After brainstorming, identify 2-3 most probable causes to investigate Verify with Data Don’t assume - test hypotheses with data before implementing fixes 11.6.4 Video: How to Create a Fishbone Diagram 11.7 Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) Fault Tree Analysis is a top-down, deductive analysis method that uses Boolean logic to analyze undesired events. Originally developed for the aerospace industry, FTA is particularly useful for complex systems with multiple potential failure paths. 11.7.1 FTA Symbols Table 11.13: Table 11.14: Fault Tree Analysis Symbols Symbol Name Meaning Example Rectangle Intermediate Event A fault event that results from combination of other events Pump fails to deliver flow Circle Basic Event A basic failure that cannot be broken down further Motor winding burnout Diamond Undeveloped Event Event not analyzed further (outside scope or insufficient data) Power grid failure House Normal Event An event expected to occur during normal operation Normal wear over time AND Gate AND Gate Output occurs only if ALL inputs occur Both sensor AND controller fail OR Gate OR Gate Output occurs if ANY input occurs Either fuse blows OR breaker trips 11.7.2 FTA Example: Pump Fails to Deliver Flow 11.7.3 Calculating Probability with FTA FTA allows quantitative risk analysis by calculating the probability of the top event: OR Gate: P(output) = 1 - [(1 - PA) × (1 - PB) × …] Simplified: P(output) ≈ PA + PB (when probabilities are small) AND Gate: P(output) = PA × PB × … # Example: Calculate top event probability # Basic event probabilities (annual failure rates) P_breaker_trip &lt;- 0.02 P_motor_fail &lt;- 0.01 P_impeller_worn &lt;- 0.03 P_impeller_break &lt;- 0.005 P_shaft_seize &lt;- 0.008 P_tank_empty &lt;- 0.05 P_valve_closed &lt;- 0.01 P_line_blocked &lt;- 0.02 # Impeller failure (OR gate) P_impeller_fail &lt;- 1 - (1 - P_impeller_worn) * (1 - P_impeller_break) cat(&quot;P(Impeller failure):&quot;, round(P_impeller_fail, 4), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## P(Impeller failure): 0.0349 # Mechanical failure (OR gate) P_mechanical &lt;- 1 - (1 - P_motor_fail) * (1 - P_impeller_fail) * (1 - P_shaft_seize) cat(&quot;P(Mechanical failure):&quot;, round(P_mechanical, 4), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## P(Mechanical failure): 0.0521 # No fluid available (OR gate) P_no_fluid &lt;- 1 - (1 - P_tank_empty) * (1 - P_valve_closed) * (1 - P_line_blocked) cat(&quot;P(No fluid available):&quot;, round(P_no_fluid, 4), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## P(No fluid available): 0.0783 # Top event: Pump fails (OR gate) P_top &lt;- 1 - (1 - P_breaker_trip) * (1 - P_mechanical) * (1 - P_no_fluid) cat(&quot;P(Pump fails to deliver flow):&quot;, round(P_top, 4), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## P(Pump fails to deliver flow): 0.1438 cat(&quot;This represents a&quot;, round(P_top * 100, 1), &quot;% annual probability of failure&quot;) ## This represents a 14.4 % annual probability of failure 11.8 Pareto Analysis Pareto Analysis is based on the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule): roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. This helps prioritize problem-solving efforts. 11.8.1 Creating a Pareto Chart 11.8.2 Interpreting Pareto Analysis # Pareto analysis interpretation defects &lt;- data.frame( Defect = c(&quot;Surface Scratch&quot;, &quot;Dimensional Error&quot;, &quot;Burrs&quot;, &quot;Missing Feature&quot;, &quot;Wrong Material&quot;, &quot;Contamination&quot;, &quot;Color Mismatch&quot;, &quot;Packaging Damage&quot;), Count = c(145, 98, 67, 34, 28, 21, 15, 12) ) defects &lt;- defects[order(-defects$Count),] defects$Cumulative_Pct &lt;- cumsum(defects$Count) / sum(defects$Count) * 100 # Identify the &quot;vital few&quot; (those that contribute to 80%) vital_few &lt;- defects[defects$Cumulative_Pct &lt;= 80 | c(TRUE, defects$Cumulative_Pct[-nrow(defects)] &lt; 80),] cat(&quot;Total defects:&quot;, sum(defects$Count), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Total defects: 420 cat(&quot;\\nVital Few (contributing to ~80% of defects):\\n&quot;) ## ## Vital Few (contributing to ~80% of defects): print(vital_few[, c(&quot;Defect&quot;, &quot;Count&quot;, &quot;Cumulative_Pct&quot;)]) ## Defect Count Cumulative_Pct ## 1 Surface Scratch 145 34.52381 ## 2 Dimensional Error 98 57.85714 ## 3 Burrs 67 73.80952 ## 4 Missing Feature 34 81.90476 cat(&quot;\\nFocusing on these&quot;, nrow(vital_few), &quot;defect types addresses&quot;, round(max(vital_few$Cumulative_Pct), 1), &quot;% of all defects&quot;) ## ## Focusing on these 4 defect types addresses 81.9 % of all defects 11.8.3 Stratified Pareto Analysis Sometimes you need to break down categories further: 11.9 Is/Is Not Analysis Is/Is Not Analysis is a structured comparison technique that helps narrow down the scope and identify distinguishing factors of a problem. 11.9.1 Is/Is Not Matrix Table 11.15: Table 11.16: Is/Is Not Analysis: Motor Overheating Problem Dimension Question IS IS NOT What’s Different? WHAT What object has the problem? Motor on Line 3 Motors on Lines 1, 2, 4 Line 3 motor is older, different model WHAT What is the defect/symptom? Overheating (85°C) Noise, vibration, or failure Thermal issue, not mechanical yet WHERE Where is the problem observed? Packaging area, Station 4 Any other station Station 4 has higher load demand WHERE Where on the object is the defect? Motor housing, bearing end Drive end, junction box Bearing end runs hotter normally WHEN When was it first observed? Monday morning shift Before weekend (Friday OK) Something changed over weekend WHEN When in the process/cycle? After 2 hours of operation Cold start or end of shift Heat buildup issue EXTENT How many units affected? 100% - every shift Intermittent Consistent problem EXTENT Is it trending up/down/stable? Stable - same every day Getting worse over time Stable - not progressive failure 11.9.2 Key Insights from Is/Is Not Analysis From the example above, we can identify: Line 3 specific - Not a general problem across all lines Thermal, not mechanical - Overheating but no noise/vibration yet After warm-up - Heat accumulation issue Started after weekend - Something changed Investigation focus: What changed over the weekend? Check maintenance logs, any work done on Line 3, any environmental changes. 11.10 The 8D Problem-Solving Methodology The 8D (Eight Disciplines) methodology is a comprehensive problem-solving approach developed by Ford Motor Company. It’s widely used in automotive and other industries. 11.10.1 Detailed 8D Steps Table 11.17: Table 11.18: 8D Methodology Detailed Breakdown Discipline Key Activities Deliverables D0: Plan Emergency response actions, initial assessment, determine if 8D needed 8D initiation decision, emergency actions D1: Team Select team leader, identify required expertise, define roles Team charter, member list with expertise D2: Problem 5W2H, Is/Is Not, quantify impact, identify affected parts/lots Problem statement, scope definition D3: Containment Sort suspect material, increase inspection, alert downstream Containment actions, protected customer D4: Root Cause 5 Whys, Fishbone, FTA, verify cause by testing Verified root cause(s) D5: Corrective Actions Brainstorm solutions, verify effectiveness before full rollout Verified corrective action plan D6: Implementation Execute action plan, validate results, monitor KPIs Implemented actions, validated results D7: Prevention Update FMEAs, procedures, training, share across organization Updated procedures, similar problem prevention D8: Closure Final documentation, lessons learned, team recognition 8D report, closed status 11.10.2 D3: Containment Actions Containment is crucial to protect the customer while you investigate: Table 11.19: Table 11.20: Types of Containment Actions Type Description Example Sort &amp; Inspect 100% inspection of suspect inventory to separate good from bad Inspect all parts from Lot 2024-0215 Rework/Repair Repair nonconforming units if possible and economical Re-machine undersize diameters to specification Scrap Dispose of units that cannot be repaired Dispose of parts with cracks Hold/Quarantine Prevent movement of suspect material until disposition Tag and segregate all parts from affected shift Increase Monitoring Add inspections, increase sampling, tighten control limits Add 100% visual inspection at Pack station Supplier Notification Notify suppliers if incoming material is suspected Request material certification from steel supplier Customer Alert Alert customers to check their inventory if product shipped Contact distributor about potentially affected batch 11.11 Corrective Action Implementation Effective corrective actions address the root cause and prevent recurrence. 11.11.1 Types of Corrective Actions 11.11.2 SMART Corrective Actions Corrective actions should be SMART: Table 11.21: Table 11.22: SMART Corrective Action Criteria Meaning Description Poor Example Good Example S Specific Clearly defined action, not vague Improve quality Install poka-yoke sensor on Station 3 to detect missing holes M Measurable Can verify completion and effectiveness Train operators Train all operators on new SOP-234 with signed competency verification A Achievable Realistic with available resources Redesign entire product line Add inspection step (1 min/part) with existing CMM capacity R Relevant Directly addresses the root cause Repaint the floor Add check fixture to verify hole position before assembly T Time-bound Has a target completion date Do this sometime soon Complete by March 15, 2024 11.12 Verification and Validation Before closing out a problem, verify that your actions worked. 11.12.1 Verification vs. Validation Table 11.23: Table 11.24: Verification vs. Validation of Corrective Actions Aspect Verification Validation Definition Did we implement the action correctly?

Customer complaints have increased, and the plant has received a quality alert. 11.13.2 Initial Problem Definition (5W2H) Table 11.25: Table 11.26: Case Study Problem Definition Question Details WHAT Porosity (gas pockets) in MIG welds on crossmember subassembly WHERE Robot welding Cell 4, occurring at weld joint W-23 (corner weld) WHEN Started approximately 2 weeks ago, occurs on all shifts WHO Detected by customer during their incoming inspection WHY Customer rejecting parts; risk of production line stop HOW Visible voids on X-ray inspection; some visible to naked eye HOW MUCH Estimated 8% of parts affected (up from baseline of 0.5%) 11.13.3 5 Whys Analysis Table 11.27: Table 11.28: 5 Whys Analysis: Weld Porosity Level Finding Problem Porosity in welds at joint W-23 Why #1 Gas entrapment during solidification Why #2 Inadequate shielding gas coverage Why #3 Gas flow rate dropped below specification Why #4 Flow meter was not calibrated; showing higher than actual Why #5 No calibration schedule existed for welding gas flow meters 11.13.4 Fishbone Diagram Findings After brainstorming with the cross-functional team: Table 11.29: Table 11.30: Fishbone Analysis Results with Verification Category Potential Cause Likelihood Verification Result Machine Gas flow meter out of calibration HIGH YES - Root cause Machine Worn contact tip affecting arc stability Medium No - tips OK Material Different wire lot from new supplier Medium No - tested OK Material Base metal surface contamination Low No - clean parts Method Robot path too fast for corner weld Medium Partial contributor Method Gas pre-flow time insufficient HIGH YES - Contributing Man Recent operator turnover, less experience Low No - all shifts affected Environment Seasonal humidity changes Low No - controlled 11.13.5 8D Report Summary Table 11.31: Table 11.32: 8D Report: Weld Porosity Case Study D# Discipline Summary D1 Team Team: Weld Engineer (lead), Quality, Maintenance, Production Supervisor, Supplier Quality D2 Problem 8% porosity rate at W-23 joint since Jan 15; customer quality alert received Jan 28 D3 Containment 100% X-ray inspection of all crossmembers; sort and quarantine 3 days production D4 Root Cause Primary: Flow meter out of calibration (reading 25 CFH, actual 18 CFH).

Provide an example of each for a machine that is producing parts with excessive surface roughness. Answer: Symptom: The observable effect of the problem Example: Parts have Ra surface roughness of 3.2 μm when specification is 1.6 μm Immediate cause: The direct, technical cause of the symptom Example: Cutting tool is worn beyond its effective life Root cause: The fundamental reason that, if eliminated, prevents recurrence Example: No tool life monitoring system exists; operators judge tool changes by intuition rather than data Fixing the root cause (implementing tool life tracking) prevents the problem from recurring, whereas just replacing the tool (addressing immediate cause) means it will happen again. Question 2: A food processing plant is experiencing frequent jams on their packaging line. Perform a 5 Whys analysis given the following information: The jam occurs at the carton loading station, started last week, happens 4-5 times per shift, and the maintenance team found the timing of the pusher mechanism is off. Answer: Problem: Carton loading station jams 4-5 times per shift Why #1: Cartons are not in position when pusher activates → Timing mismatch Why #2: Pusher timing is off by approximately 0.3 seconds Why #3: Timing adjustment was changed during last week’s maintenance Why #4: Technician didn’t have correct specification for timing setting Why #5: Maintenance procedure doesn’t include timing specifications Root Cause: Maintenance procedures lack critical parameter specifications Corrective Actions: - Update maintenance procedure with correct timing specification (180ms ± 10ms) - Restore timing to correct setting immediately - Review other procedures for missing specifications - Add parameter verification checklist to PM activities Question 3: Create a fishbone diagram outline (list the potential causes under each 6M category) for the problem “CNC machine producing parts 0.05mm oversize.” Answer: MAN (People) - Operator entered wrong offset - Incorrect setup procedure followed - Inadequate training on new program - Fatigue/distraction during setup MACHINE (Equipment) - Spindle thermal growth - Ballscrew wear/backlash - Tool holder runout - Axis positioning error MATERIAL - Material hardness variation - Different lot from supplier - Material springback - Incorrect material grade METHOD (Process) - Wrong tool offset entered - Program error in G-code - Incorrect cutting parameters - Missing roughing pass MEASUREMENT - Gauge out of calibration - Wrong measurement technique - Temperature affecting measurement - Incorrect datum reference MOTHER NATURE (Environment) - Shop temperature variation - Coolant temperature change - Vibration from nearby equipment - Humidity affecting gauges Question 4: Given the following defect data from a sheet metal stamping operation, create a Pareto analysis and identify the vital few defects to focus on. Defect Type Count Scratches 89 Burrs 156 Wrinkles 45 Splits/Cracks 28 Dimensional 112 Surface Dents 67 Missing Features 18 Answer: # Create and analyze the data defects &lt;- data.frame( Type = c(&quot;Burrs&quot;, &quot;Dimensional&quot;, &quot;Scratches&quot;, &quot;Surface Dents&quot;, &quot;Wrinkles&quot;, &quot;Splits/Cracks&quot;, &quot;Missing Features&quot;), Count = c(156, 112, 89, 67, 45, 28, 18) ) # Sort by count descending defects &lt;- defects[order(-defects$Count),] # Calculate percentages defects$Percent &lt;- defects$Count / sum(defects$Count) * 100 defects$Cumulative &lt;- cumsum(defects$Percent) # Display results print(defects) ## Type Count Percent Cumulative ## 1 Burrs 156 30.291262 30.29126 ## 2 Dimensional 112 21.747573 52.03883 ## 3 Scratches 89 17.281553 69.32039 ## 4 Surface Dents 67 13.009709 82.33010 ## 5 Wrinkles 45 8.737864 91.06796 ## 6 Splits/Cracks 28 5.436893 96.50485 ## 7 Missing Features 18 3.495146 100.00000 # Identify vital few vital_few &lt;- defects$Type[defects$Cumulative &lt;= 80 | c(TRUE, defects$Cumulative[-nrow(defects)] &lt; 80)] cat(&quot;\\nVital Few (contributing to ~80%):&quot;, paste(vital_few, collapse = &quot;, &quot;)) ## ## Vital Few (contributing to ~80%): Burrs, Dimensional, Scratches, Surface Dents The vital few are Burrs, Dimensional errors, and Scratches - addressing these three defect types would address approximately 69% of all defects. Adding Surface Dents would bring the total to 82%. Question 5: What are the key differences between verification and validation in the context of corrective actions? Answer: Aspect Verification Validation Question asked Did we implement the action correctly? Did the action solve the problem? Focus Process compliance Results/outcomes Timing During/immediately after implementation Ongoing monitoring after implementation Methods Audits, checklists, inspections Data analysis, trend charts, SPC Example Confirm new sensor was installed per specification Measure defect rate over 30 days to confirm reduction Verification confirms the action was done right. Validation confirms we did the right action. Both are required - an action can be implemented perfectly (verified) but still not solve the problem (not validated). Question 6: An aerospace manufacturer has a requirement to use the 8D methodology for customer complaints. What happens in D3 (Containment) and why is it critical? Answer: D3 Containment Actions protect the customer while the root cause investigation continues. Key activities include: Immediate actions: Quarantine suspect inventory (tagged, segregated) 100% inspection of suspect lots Increase monitoring at subsequent operations Sort parts at customer location if already shipped Documentation: Identify affected lot numbers, date codes, serial numbers Quantify the scope of potential exposure Document all containment actions taken Communication: Notify customer of actions being taken Alert downstream operations Inform suppliers if incoming material involved Why critical: - Prevents additional defective product from reaching the customer - Limits the scope of the problem (cost, liability) - Demonstrates responsiveness to customer - Buys time for proper root cause investigation - In aerospace, safety-of-flight concerns make containment essential Without effective containment, the problem continues while you investigate, increasing customer impact and costs exponentially. Question 7: Why might a team’s 5 Whys analysis stop too early? What are signs that you haven’t reached the true root cause? Answer: Reasons teams stop too early: 1. Blame arrives - Analysis ends at “operator error” without asking why the error occurred 2. Comfort zone - Team stops when they reach a cause they can easily fix 3. Time pressure - Rush to implement a fix, skipping deeper analysis 4. Technical limit - Team lacks expertise to go deeper into certain areas 5. Defensiveness - Reaching causes that implicate management or systems creates resistance Signs you haven’t reached root cause: 1. Recurrence - If the fix is “more training” or “be more careful,” problem will return 2. Human-based answer - Root causes should typically be systems/processes, not individuals 3. No prevention mechanism - If fixing this cause doesn’t prevent future occurrences, keep asking why 4. Can still ask “why?” - If there’s a logical next level to investigate 5. Administrative fix only - If the solution is just a procedure or checklist with no engineering controls Example of stopping too early: - Stopping at: “Operator set wrong parameter” - Should continue: Why? → No parameter sheet at workstation → Why? → No standard work documentation exists → Root cause: Missing standardized work process The true root cause typically relates to systems, processes, or management decisions rather than individual actions. Question 8: Describe how you would use Pareto analysis in a stratified manner to drill down into a quality problem. Answer: Stratified Pareto Analysis involves creating multiple levels of Pareto charts, progressively drilling down into the vital few categories. Example: High scrap rate at a machining shop Level 1: Scrap by defect type 1. Create Pareto of all defect types 2. Result: “Dimensional errors” is 45% of all scrap - investigate this first Level 2: Dimensional errors by machine 1. Create Pareto of dimensional errors broken down by machine 2. Result: Machine #4 accounts for 60% of dimensional errors Level 3: Machine #4 dimensional errors by feature 1. Create Pareto of which dimensions are failing on Machine #4 2. Result: Bore diameter is 70% of Machine #4 dimensional issues Level 4: Bore diameter issues by shift/operator 1. Create Pareto by shift 2. Result: Evenly distributed - not operator-dependent (machine issue confirmed) Final Analysis: Investigate boring operation on Machine #4 specifically - likely tool wear, spindle issue, or program error. The stratified approach efficiently narrows focus from “we have a scrap problem” to “boring operation on Machine #4 has a systematic error.” Question 9: A defense contractor needs to analyze a safety-critical failure. Why might Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) be preferred over simpler methods like 5 Whys? Answer: FTA advantages for safety-critical analysis: Handles complexity: Safety-critical systems often have multiple redundancies and complex failure paths FTA can model combinations of events that must occur together (AND gates) or alternatively (OR gates) 5 Whys follows single linear path; FTA captures parallel paths Quantitative capability: FTA allows probability calculations for top event Can identify minimum cut sets (smallest combinations that cause failure) Supports reliability and safety integrity level (SIL) calculations Defense/aerospace require quantitative risk assessment Documentation requirements: Regulatory bodies (FAA, DoD) often require FTA for critical systems Provides auditable, traceable analysis Standard symbols and methodology Identifies hidden failures: Can reveal single points of failure Shows where redundancy is (or isn’t) effective Identifies common cause failures that defeat redundancy Design improvement: Visual representation helps identify where to add safeguards Sensitivity analysis shows which basic events most affect risk Supports design reviews and safety cases Example: A missile guidance system failure - 5 Whys might identify one cause path - FTA would show all possible failure paths, calculate overall failure probability, and identify that two specific sensor failures AND a software error all occurring together could cause the top event, even though each alone is unlikely. 11.19 References Latino, R.J., Latino, K.C., &amp; Latino, M.A. (2019).

verify measurement quality first Accuracy components - Bias, linearity, and stability affect location (average) Precision components - Repeatability (within operator) and reproducibility (between operators) Key metrics - %GRR &lt; 30% and ndc ≥ 5 for acceptable systems Resolution matters - 10:1 ratio vs. tolerance or process variation Attribute MSA - Use Kappa for pass/fail decisions Continuous improvement - Regular verification and recertification “The measurement system is part of the process. Fix the measurement system before trying to fix the process.” 12.13 Review Questions Question 1: A gauge R&amp;R study yields %GRR = 45% and ndc = 2. What does this mean and what should be done? Answer: This measurement system is unacceptable: %GRR = 45% exceeds the 30% maximum threshold, meaning 45% of the observed variation is due to the measurement system, not the parts ndc = 2 indicates the gauge can only distinguish between 2 categories of parts, which is insufficient for process control (minimum 5 required) Actions required: 1. Investigate root causes of high variation: - Check gauge calibration and condition - Evaluate operator technique and training - Review measurement procedure for ambiguity - Assess fixture and part positioning - Check gauge resolution adequacy Prioritize improvement efforts: If repeatability (EV) is high: Focus on gauge condition, fixture, technique consistency If reproducibility (AV) is high: Focus on training, procedure clarity, technique standardization Re-run study after improvements If improvements insufficient, consider upgrading to a higher-capability gauge Until resolved, this gauge should not be used for process control or capability studies Question 2: What is the difference between repeatability and reproducibility? Give an example of each source of error. Answer: Repeatability (Equipment Variation - EV): - Variation when the same operator measures the same part multiple times with the same gauge - Also called “within-operator” variation - Represents the inherent precision of the gauge and measurement technique Examples of repeatability errors: - Gauge resolution limitations - Gauge mechanism play/backlash - Inconsistent part positioning in fixture - Variations in technique even by same operator - Environmental micro-changes during measurement Reproducibility (Appraiser Variation - AV): - Variation when different operators measure the same parts - Also called “between-operator” variation - Represents differences in how operators apply the measurement method Examples of reproducibility errors: - Different technique between operators (pressure applied, angle, etc.) - Different interpretation of measurement procedure - Different reading of analog scales - Training differences - Physical differences (eyesight, hand steadiness) Question 3: Calculate the bias and determine if it is acceptable. Reference value = 25.000 mm, Tolerance = ±0.050 mm, Measured values: 25.012, 25.015, 25.008, 25.011, 25.014, 25.009, 25.013, 25.010, 25.012, 25.011 Answer: reference &lt;- 25.000 tolerance_total &lt;- 0.100 # ±0.050 = 0.100 total measurements &lt;- c(25.012, 25.015, 25.008, 25.011, 25.014, 25.009, 25.013, 25.010, 25.012, 25.011) # Calculate bias mean_measured &lt;- mean(measurements) bias &lt;- mean_measured - reference cat(&quot;Reference value:&quot;, reference, &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## Reference value: 25 mm cat(&quot;Mean measured:&quot;, round(mean_measured, 4), &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## Mean measured: 25.0115 mm cat(&quot;Bias:&quot;, round(bias, 4), &quot;mm\\n\\n&quot;) ## Bias: 0.0115 mm # Express as % of tolerance bias_pct &lt;- abs(bias) / tolerance_total * 100 cat(&quot;Bias as % of tolerance:&quot;, round(bias_pct, 1), &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Bias as % of tolerance: 11.5 % # T-test for significance t_result &lt;- t.test(measurements, mu = reference) cat(&quot;T-test p-value:&quot;, round(t_result$p.value, 6), &quot;\\n\\n&quot;) ## T-test p-value: 0 # Acceptability cat(&quot;Acceptability Assessment:\\n&quot;) ## Acceptability Assessment: if(bias_pct &lt; 10) { cat(&quot;- Bias &lt; 10% of tolerance: ACCEPTABLE\\n&quot;) } else if(bias_pct &lt; 25) { cat(&quot;- Bias 10-25% of tolerance: MARGINAL\\n&quot;) } else { cat(&quot;- Bias &gt; 25% of tolerance: UNACCEPTABLE\\n&quot;) } ## - Bias 10-25% of tolerance: MARGINAL if(t_result$p.value &lt; 0.05) { cat(&quot;- Bias is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05)\\n&quot;) cat(&quot;- Consider recalibration or technique adjustment\\n&quot;) } ## - Bias is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) ## - Consider recalibration or technique adjustment The bias of 0.0115 mm (11.5% of tolerance) is marginally acceptable and statistically significant. Recalibration should be considered. Question 4: Why is it important to conduct MSA before capability studies (Cp, Cpk)? Answer: MSA must precede capability studies because measurement error directly inflates observed variation: Mathematical Relationship: \\[\\sigma^2_{observed} = \\sigma^2_{process} + \\sigma^2_{measurement}\\] Impacts on Capability: Understated Cp/Cpk: Observed sigma is always larger than true process sigma, so calculated capability will be lower than actual capability False Alarms: A capable process may appear incapable due to measurement noise, leading to unnecessary process adjustments or investment Missed Issues: High measurement variation masks actual process variation; you can’t see problems through the “fog” of gauge error Bad Decisions: Incorrect capability data leads to: Wrong process acceptance decisions Inappropriate control limits Misguided improvement investments Customer quality issues Example: - True process: Cpk = 1.5 (very capable) - With 50% GRR: Observed Cpk ≈ 0.9 (appears incapable) - Result: Unnecessary process “improvement” efforts Rule of Thumb: If %GRR &gt; 30%, any capability study is essentially meaningless because too much of the observed variation is measurement noise, not real process variation. Question 5: A visual inspection has the following results: Kappa vs. reference = 0.72, within-operator agreement = 88%, between-operator agreement = 75%. Evaluate this attribute measurement system. Answer: Results Interpretation: Kappa vs. Reference = 0.72 Falls in “Substantial agreement” range (0.61-0.80) Operators are correctly classifying parts most of the time Acceptable for many applications, but improvement possible Within-Operator Agreement = 88% Operators are fairly consistent with themselves 12% of the time, same operator gives different result on same part Should target &gt;90% for critical inspections Between-Operator Agreement = 75% Operators disagree on 25% of parts This is a significant reproducibility issue Major source of inconsistency in product quality Assessment: MARGINAL - Improvement Needed Recommended Actions: Standardize criteria: Create clear visual standards with boundary samples Photos of accept/reject borderline cases Written descriptions of defect criteria Training: Calibration session with all operators and reference samples Identify operators with lower agreement for targeted training Improve conditions: Check lighting adequacy and consistency Ensure proper viewing distance and angle Reduce fatigue with appropriate break schedules Consider automation: For critical inspections, automated vision systems may provide better consistency Re-study after improvements to verify effectiveness Question 6: What is the “Rule of Ten” for gauge resolution, and how would you apply it? Answer: The Rule of Ten: The gauge resolution should be at least 1/10 of the tolerance or 1/10 of the process variation (6σ), whichever is smaller. \\[\\text{Resolution} \\leq \\frac{\\min(\\text{Tolerance}, 6\\sigma)}{10}\\] Application Example: Given: - Part tolerance: ±0.05 mm (total = 0.10 mm) - Process 6σ: 0.08 mm - Available gauges: 0.01 mm resolution, 0.001 mm resolution Calculation: Required resolution ≤ min(0.10, 0.08) / 10 Required resolution ≤ 0.08 / 10 Required resolution ≤ 0.008 mm Assessment: - 0.01 mm gauge: 0.01 &gt; 0.008 → INADEQUATE - 0.001 mm gauge: 0.001 &lt; 0.008 → ADEQUATE Why It Matters: 1. If resolution is too coarse, gauge cannot detect small part differences 2. Results in low ndc (number of distinct categories) 3. Control charts will show “stair-step” patterns 4. Capability studies will be inaccurate Practical Tips: - For SPC applications, 10:1 is minimum; 20:1 is preferred - For capability studies, 10:1 is acceptable - For simple pass/fail gauging, 5:1 may be acceptable Question 7: Given the following ANOVA table from a Gauge R&amp;R study, calculate the variance components and %GRR.

Answer: When repeatability is high (main contributor to GRR) but reproducibility is low, the measurement variation is coming from the gauge/equipment/technique rather than differences between operators. Root Cause Investigation - Focus Areas: Gauge Condition Worn measuring surfaces or contacts Loose components or mechanism play Damaged or dirty probe/sensor Gauge Resolution Resolution may be inadequate for the tolerance Check 10:1 rule compliance Fixture/Fixturing Part not held consistently Fixture wear or damage Part not seating properly Measurement Technique Inconsistent contact force Varying measurement location on part Speed of measurement varies Part Characteristics Part surface finish affecting readings Part flexibility/deflection during measurement Part temperature variation Environment Vibration affecting readings Temperature instability Contamination Improvement Actions: Priority Action 1 Verify gauge calibration and condition; repair/replace if needed 2 Check and improve fixture; ensure consistent part positioning 3 Evaluate and potentially upgrade gauge resolution 4 Standardize technique (force, speed, location) 5 Control environmental factors 6 Re-run study to verify improvement Note: Low AV in this case is actually good - it means operators are consistent with each other. The problem is the measurement equipment itself. 12.14 References AIAG. (2010). Measurement Systems Analysis Reference Manual (4th ed.). Automotive Industry Action Group. Wheeler, D.J. (2006).

Key Principle: Data flows up (process information), commands flow down (control directives). 13.4 Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) The PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) is the workhorse of industrial automation, providing reliable, real-time control of machines and processes. 13.4.1 What is a PLC? 13.4.2 PLC Hardware Components Table 13.5: Table 13.6: PLC Hardware Components Component Function Specifications CPU (Processor) Executes the control program, manages memory, coordinates all modules Scan time (ms), memory size (KB/MB), I/O capacity Power Supply Converts AC power to DC voltages required by PLC components Input voltage (120/240 VAC), output power (watts) Input Modules Interface field devices (sensors, switches) to CPU; converts signals to digital Digital (24VDC, 120VAC) or Analog (4-20mA, 0-10V) Output Modules Interface CPU to field devices (motors, valves); converts digital to power signals Digital (relay, transistor) or Analog (4-20mA, 0-10V) Communication Modules Enable networking: Ethernet/IP, Profinet, Modbus, DeviceNet Protocol, speed (Mbps), ports Programming Device Laptop/PC with programming software for creating and downloading programs Software: RSLogix, TIA Portal, GX Works 13.4.3 The PLC Scan Cycle PLCs operate in a continuous scan cycle: # Scan Time Calculation Example input_scan_time &lt;- 1.2 # ms program_execution &lt;- 15.5 # ms (depends on program size) output_update &lt;- 1.0 # ms housekeeping &lt;- 2.3 # ms total_scan_time &lt;- input_scan_time + program_execution + output_update + housekeeping cat(&quot;PLC Scan Time Calculation:\\n&quot;) ## PLC Scan Time Calculation: cat(&quot;─────────────────────────────\\n&quot;) ## ───────────────────────────── cat(&quot;Input Scan: &quot;, input_scan_time, &quot;ms\\n&quot;) ## Input Scan: 1.2 ms cat(&quot;Program Execution:&quot;, program_execution, &quot;ms\\n&quot;) ## Program Execution: 15.5 ms cat(&quot;Output Update: &quot;, output_update, &quot;ms\\n&quot;) ## Output Update: 1 ms cat(&quot;Housekeeping: &quot;, housekeeping, &quot;ms\\n&quot;) ## Housekeeping: 2.3 ms cat(&quot;─────────────────────────────\\n&quot;) ## ───────────────────────────── cat(&quot;Total Scan Time: &quot;, total_scan_time, &quot;ms\\n&quot;) ## Total Scan Time: 20 ms cat(&quot;\\nScans per second: &quot;, round(1000/total_scan_time, 0), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## ## Scans per second: 50 13.4.4 PLC Programming Languages (IEC 61131-3) Table 13.7: Table 13.8: IEC 61131-3 PLC Programming Languages Language Type Description Best For Ladder Diagram (LD) Graphical Resembles electrical relay circuits; most common in discrete manufacturing Boolean logic, interlocks, machine control Function Block Diagram (FBD) Graphical Uses function blocks connected by lines; good for analog/process control PID loops, motion control, data manipulation Structured Text (ST) Textual High-level language similar to Pascal; powerful for complex calculations Math operations, data handling, complex algorithms Instruction List (IL) Textual Low-level assembly-like language; rarely used today Legacy systems, compact code Sequential Function Chart (SFC) Graphical Sequence/state-based programming; excellent for batch processes Sequential operations, batch control, recipes 13.4.5 Ladder Logic Example How the Start/Stop Circuit Works Rung 1 - Motor Control: 1. Power flows from L1 through the NC (Normally Closed) STOP button 2. If STOP is pressed, the circuit breaks and motor stops 3. START is NO (Normally Open) - pressing it allows power to flow to the MOTOR coil 4. When MOTOR energizes, its NO contact in the parallel branch closes 5. This “seals in” the circuit - motor stays running even after START is released 6. To stop, press STOP which breaks the seal-in circuit Rung 2 - Run Indicator: 1. When MOTOR coil is energized, the MOTOR contact closes 2. This allows power to flow to the RUN LIGHT output 3. Light is ON whenever motor is running This is called a “3-wire control” circuit - it provides: - Low voltage release protection (motor won’t restart after power failure) - Maintained contact operation (don’t need to hold START button) 13.5 Industrial Sensors Sensors are the “eyes and ears” of automation systems, providing feedback about the process to the control system. 13.5.1 Sensor Classification Table 13.9: Table 13.10: Common Industrial Sensor Specifications Sensor Principle Range Advantages Inductive Proximity Eddy current change in oscillating field 2-40mm typical Durable, no contact, metal detection Capacitive Proximity Capacitance change with target approach 2-25mm typical Detects any material, through walls Photoelectric Light beam interrupted or reflected 0.1-30m Long range, versatile RTD (PT100) Resistance changes with temperature -200 to 850°C Accurate, stable, linear Thermocouple Voltage generated at junction of dissimilar metals -200 to 2300°C Wide range, fast response Pressure Transducer Diaphragm deflection converted to electrical signal 0-10000 psi Accurate, wide range Incremental Encoder Optical/magnetic pulses per revolution 100-10000 PPR Simple, low cost, high resolution Absolute Encoder Unique code for each position 12-25 bit Position known at power-up 13.5.2 Sensor Wiring: PNP vs NPN 13.6 Actuators and Motor Control Actuators convert control signals into physical motion or action. 13.6.1 Types of Industrial Actuators Table 13.11: Table 13.12: Industrial Actuator Types and Applications Category Type Application Control Characteristics Electric Electric Motors AC Induction Motor Conveyors, pumps, fans, compressors VFD for variable speed Robust, low cost, high power Electric Motors Servo Motor Precise positioning, robotics, CNC Servo drive with feedback High precision, dynamic response Electric Motors Stepper Motor Indexing, low-speed positioning Stepper drive (open or closed loop) Simple control, holds position Electric Motors DC Motor Battery vehicles, legacy systems PWM, SCR drive Easy speed control Pneumatic Pneumatic Cylinder Clamping, pushing, lifting Solenoid valves, proportional valves Fast, clean, moderate force Pneumatic Rotary Actuator Rotating grippers, indexing Solenoid valves Compact, clean Hydraulic Hydraulic Cylinder Heavy lifting, presses Proportional/servo valves Very high force, smooth Hydraulic Motor Heavy machinery, mobile equipment Proportional/servo valves High power density 13.6.2 Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) A Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) controls AC motor speed by varying the frequency and voltage of the power supplied to the motor. # VFD Speed and Torque Calculations # Motor nameplate data motor_hp &lt;- 10 poles &lt;- 4 rated_voltage &lt;- 460 # V rated_frequency &lt;- 60 # Hz rated_rpm &lt;- 1750 slip_rpm &lt;- (120 * rated_frequency / poles) - rated_rpm # Synchronous speed at rated frequency sync_speed_60 &lt;- 120 * rated_frequency / poles cat(&quot;Motor Data:\\n&quot;) ## Motor Data: cat(&quot;Synchronous speed at 60Hz:&quot;, sync_speed_60, &quot;RPM\\n&quot;) ## Synchronous speed at 60Hz: 1800 RPM cat(&quot;Rated speed:&quot;, rated_rpm, &quot;RPM\\n&quot;) ## Rated speed: 1750 RPM cat(&quot;Slip:&quot;, slip_rpm, &quot;RPM (&quot;, round(slip_rpm/sync_speed_60*100, 1), &quot;%)\\n\\n&quot;) ## Slip: 50 RPM ( 2.8 %) # Calculate speed at different frequencies frequencies &lt;- c(15, 30, 45, 60, 75) speeds &lt;- sapply(frequencies, function(f) { sync &lt;- 120 * f / poles sync - slip_rpm # Assuming constant slip (approximation) }) cat(&quot;Speed vs Frequency (V/Hz mode):\\n&quot;) ## Speed vs Frequency (V/Hz mode): cat(&quot;─────────────────────────────\\n&quot;) ## ───────────────────────────── for(i in 1:length(frequencies)) { cat(sprintf(&quot;%2d Hz: %4d RPM\\n&quot;, frequencies[i], speeds[i])) } ## 15 Hz: 400 RPM ## 30 Hz: 850 RPM ## 45 Hz: 1300 RPM ## 60 Hz: 1750 RPM ## 75 Hz: 2200 RPM # V/Hz ratio vhz_ratio &lt;- rated_voltage / rated_frequency cat(&quot;\\nV/Hz Ratio:&quot;, round(vhz_ratio, 2), &quot;V/Hz\\n&quot;) ## ## V/Hz Ratio: 7.67 V/Hz cat(&quot;At 30Hz, voltage should be:&quot;, 30 * vhz_ratio, &quot;V\\n&quot;) ## At 30Hz, voltage should be: 230 V 13.6.3 VFD Benefits Table 13.13: Table 13.14: Variable Frequency Drive Benefits Benefit Description Typical Impact Energy Savings Match motor speed to load requirements;

Give an example application for each. Answer: Aspect Fixed Programmable Flexible Product variety Single product Batches of different products High variety, mixed production Volume Very high Medium-high Low-medium Changeover Difficult, expensive Hours to days Minutes Investment Very high High Very high Flexibility None Limited High Examples: Fixed Automation: Automotive transfer line producing engine blocks Same machining operations repeated millions of times Dedicated stations optimized for specific operations Changing product would require complete retooling Programmable Automation: CNC machining job shop Different parts programmed and run in batches Significant setup time between batches Equipment reprogrammable but not instantaneous Flexible Automation: Robotic welding cell in aerospace Different assemblies run with quick changeover Robot program changes automatically based on part ID Same cell handles multiple product variants Question 2: Explain the PLC scan cycle and why scan time is important. Answer: The PLC Scan Cycle consists of four main phases executed continuously: Input Scan (~1ms): Read all physical inputs and store values in the input image table Program Execution (~5-20ms): Execute the user program (ladder logic, etc.) using input image data Output Update (~1ms): Write output image table values to physical outputs Housekeeping (~1-3ms): Communications, diagnostics, self-testing Total scan time = Sum of all phases, typically 10-50ms Why Scan Time Matters: Response Time: An input change isn’t acted upon until the next scan completes. If scan time is 50ms, worst-case response time is 50ms. Safety: Fast-moving machinery requires short scan times for safety functions. A 100ms scan time with a motor at 1800 RPM means 3 shaft revolutions between scans. Application Limits: Motion control may need &lt;1ms scan times (special motion PLCs) High-speed counting needs special modules Safety PLCs have guaranteed maximum scan times Program Size Impact: Larger programs take longer to execute, increasing scan time. Optimization may be needed for time-critical applications. Communication Delays: Network updates typically happen once per scan, affecting data freshness. Question 3: What are the key differences between PNP and NPN sensor outputs? When would you use each? Answer: PNP (Sourcing): - Sensor output sources current TO the load - When activated, output connects to +V - Load is connected between sensor output and 0V - Current flows: +V → Sensor → Output → Load → 0V - Common in North America and Europe NPN (Sinking): - Sensor output sinks current FROM the load - When activated, output connects to 0V (ground) - Load is connected between sensor output and +V - Current flows: +V → Load → Output → Sensor → 0V - Common in Asia (Japan) Selection Criteria: PLC Input Type: Sinking PLC inputs work with PNP (sourcing) sensors Sourcing PLC inputs work with NPN (sinking) sensors Regional Standards: North America: PNP is standard Europe: PNP is standard Japan/Asia: NPN is common Safety Considerations: PNP: A ground fault can cause false ON signal NPN: A ground fault typically causes safe-off condition For safety applications, consider sensor design carefully Existing Infrastructure: Match new sensors to existing system type Converting between types requires different PLC input cards Question 4: A VFD is controlling a 10 HP, 4-pole motor rated at 1750 RPM and 460V at 60Hz. Calculate the motor speed at 30Hz and 45Hz. What voltage should the VFD supply at these frequencies? Answer: # Motor parameters poles &lt;- 4 rated_voltage &lt;- 460 # V rated_frequency &lt;- 60 # Hz rated_rpm &lt;- 1750 # Calculate synchronous speed and slip at rated conditions sync_speed_60 &lt;- 120 * rated_frequency / poles slip_rpm &lt;- sync_speed_60 - rated_rpm slip_percent &lt;- (slip_rpm / sync_speed_60) * 100 cat(&quot;Motor Analysis:\\n&quot;) ## Motor Analysis: cat(&quot;Synchronous speed at 60Hz:&quot;, sync_speed_60, &quot;RPM\\n&quot;) ## Synchronous speed at 60Hz: 1800 RPM cat(&quot;Rated speed:&quot;, rated_rpm, &quot;RPM\\n&quot;) ## Rated speed: 1750 RPM cat(&quot;Slip:&quot;, slip_rpm, &quot;RPM (&quot;, round(slip_percent, 1), &quot;%)\\n\\n&quot;) ## Slip: 50 RPM ( 2.8 %) # V/Hz ratio vhz_ratio &lt;- rated_voltage / rated_frequency cat(&quot;V/Hz Ratio:&quot;, round(vhz_ratio, 2), &quot;V/Hz\\n\\n&quot;) ## V/Hz Ratio: 7.67 V/Hz # Calculate at 30Hz freq_30 &lt;- 30 sync_30 &lt;- 120 * freq_30 / poles speed_30 &lt;- sync_30 - slip_rpm # Assuming constant slip in RPM voltage_30 &lt;- freq_30 * vhz_ratio cat(&quot;At 30Hz:\\n&quot;) ## At 30Hz: cat(&quot; Synchronous speed:&quot;, sync_30, &quot;RPM\\n&quot;) ## Synchronous speed: 900 RPM cat(&quot; Motor speed (approx):&quot;, speed_30, &quot;RPM\\n&quot;) ## Motor speed (approx): 850 RPM cat(&quot; VFD output voltage:&quot;, voltage_30, &quot;V\\n\\n&quot;) ## VFD output voltage: 230 V # Calculate at 45Hz freq_45 &lt;- 45 sync_45 &lt;- 120 * freq_45 / poles speed_45 &lt;- sync_45 - slip_rpm voltage_45 &lt;- freq_45 * vhz_ratio cat(&quot;At 45Hz:\\n&quot;) ## At 45Hz: cat(&quot; Synchronous speed:&quot;, sync_45, &quot;RPM\\n&quot;) ## Synchronous speed: 1350 RPM cat(&quot; Motor speed (approx):&quot;, speed_45, &quot;RPM\\n&quot;) ## Motor speed (approx): 1300 RPM cat(&quot; VFD output voltage:&quot;, voltage_45, &quot;V\\n&quot;) ## VFD output voltage: 345 V Note: The calculation assumes constant slip in RPM, which is an approximation. Actual slip varies somewhat with load and frequency. The V/Hz ratio is maintained constant to provide constant torque capability below base speed. Question 5: Compare Ethernet/IP and PROFINET. When would you choose each? Answer: Feature Ethernet/IP PROFINET Developer ODVA (Rockwell Automation) PROFIBUS International (Siemens) Base Protocol CIP over TCP/UDP Based on standard Ethernet Real-time CIP Motion for motion control IRT (Isochronous Real-Time) Determinism Standard: non-deterministic; CIP Sync: deterministic RT: soft real-time; IRT: hard real-time Typical Cycle 2-10ms (standard); &lt;1ms (CIP Motion) 1-10ms (RT); &lt;1ms (IRT) Ecosystem Allen-Bradley, DeviceNet-heritage Siemens, PROFIBUS-heritage Choose Ethernet/IP when: - Using Allen-Bradley/Rockwell PLCs - Integrating with DeviceNet legacy systems - Standard industrial Ethernet needs - North American installations (common) - Need CIP protocol compatibility Choose PROFINET when: - Using Siemens PLCs (S7-1200, S7-1500) - Migrating from PROFIBUS installations - Need IRT for high-performance motion - European installations (common) - Require I-Device functionality General Guidance: - Match the protocol to your PLC vendor’s ecosystem - Both are capable industrial Ethernet solutions - Consider existing infrastructure and expertise - For motion, evaluate specific timing requirements Question 6: What is the difference between HMI and SCADA? Where would each be used? Answer: HMI (Human-Machine Interface): - Local operator interface for a single machine or process - Typically a touchscreen panel mounted on or near equipment - Communicates directly with one or few PLCs - Provides real-time control and monitoring - Limited data storage (trends, alarms) - Examples: Allen-Bradley PanelView, Siemens Comfort Panel SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition): - Centralized system monitoring multiple processes/locations - Server-based architecture with multiple client workstations - Communicates with many PLCs/RTUs across large distances - Supervisory control - high-level commands, not direct control - Extensive historical data collection and analysis - Examples: Wonderware, Ignition, FactoryTalk View SE Where Each is Used: Application HMI SCADA Single CNC machine ✓ Packaging line ✓ Entire factory floor ✓ Water treatment plant ✓ (local) ✓ (central) Oil pipeline network ✓ Building automation ✓ (per zone) ✓ (campus-wide) Power grid ✓ Key Distinction: HMI is typically embedded/local for one process; SCADA is a system supervising many processes across the enterprise. Question 7: Explain what SIL 3 means and give an example of a SIL 3 application. Answer: SIL 3 (Safety Integrity Level 3) is defined in IEC 61508 and represents: PFD (Probability of Failure on Demand): 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻³ (0.01% to 0.1%) Risk Reduction Factor: 1,000 to 10,000 Availability: 99.9% to 99.99% What SIL 3 Means: - The safety function will fail to operate when needed less than 1 in 1,000 demands - Requires redundant architecture (typically 2oo3 or 1oo2D) - Requires certified safety-rated components - Requires rigorous design, testing, and validation processes - Requires regular proof testing and maintenance SIL 3 Requirements: - Hardware fault tolerance ≥ 1 (single fault won’t cause dangerous failure) - Safe Failure Fraction &gt; 90% (for Type A components) - Systematic capability rating of SC3 - Extensive documentation and lifecycle management SIL 3 Application Examples: Emergency Shutdown System (ESD) in oil refinery Detects dangerous conditions (high pressure, fire) Shuts down process and isolates fuel sources Failure could result in explosion and fatalities Burner Management System (BMS) Controls furnace/boiler ignition sequence Monitors flame presence and fuel/air ratio Prevents furnace explosions High Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS) Prevents overpressure in pipelines Isolates high-pressure source before relief valve capacity exceeded Protects against catastrophic pipeline rupture Question 8: Describe three benefits of implementing IIoT in a manufacturing facility and give a specific example of each. Answer: 1. Predictive Maintenance Benefit: Detect equipment degradation before failure, enabling planned maintenance during scheduled downtime rather than emergency repairs. Example: Vibration sensors on a conveyor gearbox transmit data to cloud analytics. Machine learning algorithms detect bearing wear signature 3 weeks before expected failure. Maintenance schedules replacement during next planned shutdown, avoiding $50,000 in lost production from unplanned downtime. 2. Real-Time Production Visibility Benefit: Instant access to production metrics, OEE, and quality data from anywhere, enabling faster decision-making. Example: Dashboard shows real-time OEE for all production lines on plant manager’s tablet. Sudden drop in Line 3 performance triggers alert. Investigation reveals material feed issue; corrected within 30 minutes instead of waiting for end-of-shift report. 3. Energy Optimization Benefit: Monitor energy consumption at machine level, identify waste, and optimize based on production schedule. Example: Power meters on each machine report to central system. Analysis reveals HVAC in unused areas runs at full capacity during weekends. Automated scheduling reduces weekend HVAC operation, saving 15% on energy bills ($30,000/year). Additional Benefits: Quality Traceability - Every part traced through production with complete process data Remote Monitoring - Engineers can diagnose issues without traveling to site Supply Chain Integration - Real-time inventory and production data shared with suppliers 13.14 References Bolton, W.

It coordinates and directs an organization’s activities to meet customer and regulatory requirements while continuously improving effectiveness. 14.2.1 Why Implement a QMS? 14.2.2 The Evolution of Quality Management Table 14.1: Table 14.2: Evolution of Quality Management Era Approach Focus Key Figures/Standards Pre-1900s Craftsmanship Individual skill; master craftsmen Guilds 1900-1940s Inspection Sort good from bad; end-of-line inspection Taylor 1940-1960s Statistical Quality Control Control charts; sampling; Shewhart, Deming Shewhart, Deming 1960-1980s Quality Assurance Prevention; systems approach; documented procedures Juran, Feigenbaum 1980-2000s Total Quality Management Company-wide quality; customer focus; continuous improvement Crosby, ISO 9000 2000s-Present Integrated Management Risk-based thinking; integration with business strategy; digital quality ISO 9001:2015, Industry 4.0 14.2.3 Quality Management Principles ISO 9000 defines seven quality management principles that form the foundation of all QMS standards: 14.3 ISO 9001:2015 Structure ISO 9001:2015 is the international standard for quality management systems. It uses the High-Level Structure (HLS) common to all ISO management system standards. 14.3.1 The Ten Clauses 14.3.2 The Process Approach and PDCA ISO 9001:2015 emphasizes the process approach combined with the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle: 14.3.3 Risk-Based Thinking ISO 9001:2015 introduced risk-based thinking throughout the QMS: Table 14.3: Table 14.4: Risk-Based Thinking in ISO 9001:2015 Clause Requirement Risk_Application 4.1 Context of the Organization Identify internal/external issues that could affect QMS outcomes 4.2 Interested Parties Understand needs/expectations that could impact quality 6.1 Actions to Address Risks and Opportunities Plan actions to address risks and opportunities; integrate into processes 8.1 Operational Planning and Control Control processes considering risks identified in planning 9.1 Monitoring and Measurement Monitor effectiveness of actions taken to address risks 10.2 Nonconformity and Corrective Action Analyze nonconformities; update risks/opportunities as needed Understanding Risk-Based Thinking Risk-based thinking doesn’t require formal risk management (like FMEA for every process), but rather: Consider risks when designing and implementing the QMS Preventive action is built into the system, not a separate activity Proportional response - more rigorous controls for higher-risk processes Opportunities are also considered (not just negative risks) Example: A food manufacturer identifies “allergen cross-contamination” as a significant risk. Risk-based thinking leads them to: - Dedicated production lines for allergen-containing products - Enhanced cleaning verification procedures - Staff training on allergen awareness - Increased inspection frequency after changeovers The extent of controls is proportional to the risk level. 14.4 Industry-Specific Quality Standards Different industries have developed standards that build upon ISO 9001 with additional sector-specific requirements. 14.4.1 Comparison of Major Standards 14.4.2 IATF 16949:2016 (Automotive) IATF 16949 is the automotive quality standard, required by most major OEMs (Ford, GM, Toyota, VW, etc.).

Answer: The seven quality management principles form an interconnected foundation: Customer Focus (Central principle) Understanding and meeting customer needs is the primary purpose All other principles support this goal Leadership Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction Create conditions for people to achieve quality objectives Enables all other principles Engagement of People Competent, empowered people at all levels Essential for effective processes and customer focus Process Approach Activities managed as interrelated processes Enables consistent, predictable results Improvement Ongoing focus on enhancing performance Essential for maintaining customer satisfaction Evidence-based Decision Making Decisions based on analysis of data Reduces uncertainty; improves decision quality Relationship Management Managing relationships with interested parties (suppliers, partners) Optimizes their impact on performance Relationships: - Customer Focus drives the need for all others - Leadership enables and supports all principles - Engagement of People is essential for Process Approach and Improvement - Evidence-based Decision Making supports Improvement - Relationship Management extends quality beyond the organization Question 2: Compare ISO 9001, IATF 16949, and AS9100. When would each be required? Answer: Standard Base Industry Additional Focus ISO 9001:2015 Standalone General Quality fundamentals IATF 16949:2016 ISO 9001 + automotive Automotive PPAP, APQP, Core Tools AS9100D ISO 9001 + aerospace Aerospace/Defense Configuration mgmt, FAI, counterfeit prevention When Required: ISO 9001: - Any organization wanting to demonstrate quality capability - Customer or contract requirement for QMS certification - Basis for all other standards - Suitable for service, manufacturing, any industry IATF 16949: - Suppliers to automotive OEMs (Ford, GM, Toyota, VW, etc.) - Required for production parts/materials - Required throughout automotive supply chain - Includes Customer-Specific Requirements (CSRs) AS9100: - Suppliers to aerospace/defense contractors - Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, military programs - Required for flight-critical components - OASIS database registration required Key Differences: - IATF 16949: Emphasizes PPAP, APQP, manufacturing process control - AS9100: Emphasizes traceability, configuration control, first article inspection - Both build on ISO 9001 with sector-specific additions Question 3: Describe the documentation hierarchy in a QMS. Give an example of each level. Answer: Level 1: Quality Policy and Objectives - Strategic direction for quality - Signed by top management - Communicated to all employees - Example: “ABC Company is committed to delivering defect-free products that meet customer requirements through continuous improvement of our processes and people.” Level 2: Quality Manual and Procedures - Describes WHAT is done and WHO is responsible - System-level documents - Example: Document Control Procedure (QP-001) - Purpose: Control creation, approval, distribution of documents - Scope: All QMS documents - Responsibilities: Document Control Coordinator, Department Managers - Process flow for document changes Level 3: Work Instructions and Specifications - Describes HOW tasks are performed - Detailed step-by-step instructions - Example: Work Instruction for CNC Lathe Setup (WI-MAC-015) - Step 1: Verify program number matches work order - Step 2: Install correct tooling per setup sheet - Step 3: Set tool offsets using touch-off procedure - Step 4: Run first piece and verify dimensions Level 4: Records and Forms - Evidence that activities were performed - Completed forms, inspection results, logs - Example: First Article Inspection Report (FM-QC-008) - Part number, revision, date - Dimensional measurements vs. specifications - Inspector signature - Disposition (Accept/Reject) Question 4: What are the key elements of an effective internal audit program? Answer: 1. Audit Program Planning - Annual audit schedule covering all QMS processes - Risk-based frequency (higher risk = more frequent) - Documented audit program procedure - Resource allocation (trained auditors, time) 2. Auditor Competence - Trained in audit techniques - Knowledge of standards (ISO 9001, industry-specific) - Understanding of processes being audited - Independence from area being audited 3. Audit Preparation - Review of relevant documents (procedures, previous audits) - Prepared checklist linked to requirements - Notification to auditee - Defined scope and objectives 4. Audit Execution - Opening meeting (purpose, scope, schedule) - Evidence collection (documents, records, interviews, observation) - Objective evaluation against criteria - Note taking and evidence documentation 5. Reporting - Clear finding statements (nonconformities, observations) - Reference to requirement violated - Objective evidence cited - Closing meeting to present findings 6. Follow-up - Corrective action requests issued - Root cause analysis required - Verification of corrective action implementation - Verification of effectiveness 7. Continuous Improvement of Audit Program - Evaluate audit program effectiveness - Update based on organizational changes - Calibrate auditors periodically - Incorporate lessons learned Question 5: Explain the difference between corrective action and preventive action. Provide an example of each. Answer: Corrective Action: - Eliminates the cause of a detected nonconformity - Reactive - responds to something that has already happened - Goal: Prevent recurrence of the specific problem Example: - Nonconformity: Customer received shipment with wrong part numbers (3 incidents in past month) - Root Cause: Shipping labels printed from outdated part number list - Corrective Action: 1. Update master part number list 2. Link shipping system directly to ERP for current data 3. Add verification step comparing label to packing list - Verification: No recurrence after 3 months Preventive Action: - Eliminates the cause of a potential nonconformity - Proactive - addresses something that hasn’t happened yet - Goal: Prevent occurrence before it happens Example: - Potential Nonconformity: New CNC machine may produce out-of-spec parts due to operator unfamiliarity - Risk Identified Through: PFMEA analysis during new equipment installation - Preventive Action: 1. Develop comprehensive training program before machine goes live 2. Create detailed setup procedures with photos 3. Implement first-article inspection for first 30 days 4. Assign experienced mentor to new operators - Verification: Track first-pass yield during initial production period Key Difference: - Corrective = Fix what went wrong - Preventive = Stop what might go wrong Note: ISO 9001:2015 doesn’t explicitly require “preventive action” as a separate process. Instead, risk-based thinking throughout the QMS serves the preventive function. Question 6: Calculate and analyze the Cost of Quality for the following data. What recommendations would you make? Category Cost Quality planning $35,000 Training $25,000 Incoming inspection $40,000 In-process inspection $55,000 Final inspection $30,000 Scrap $85,000 Rework $65,000 Warranty claims $120,000 Customer returns $45,000 Annual revenue: $8,000,000 Answer: # Cost of Quality Analysis prevention &lt;- 35000 + 25000 # Planning + Training appraisal &lt;- 40000 + 55000 + 30000 # Inspections internal_failure &lt;- 85000 + 65000 # Scrap + Rework external_failure &lt;- 120000 + 45000 # Warranty + Returns total_coq &lt;- prevention + appraisal + internal_failure + external_failure revenue &lt;- 8000000 cat(&quot;Cost of Quality Breakdown:\\n&quot;) ## Cost of Quality Breakdown: cat(&quot;─────────────────────────────\\n&quot;) ## ───────────────────────────── cat(&quot;Prevention: $&quot;, format(prevention, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;(&quot;, round(prevention/total_coq*100, 1), &quot;%)\\n&quot;) ## Prevention: $ 60,000 ( 12 %) cat(&quot;Appraisal: $&quot;, format(appraisal, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;(&quot;, round(appraisal/total_coq*100, 1), &quot;%)\\n&quot;) ## Appraisal: $ 125,000 ( 25 %) cat(&quot;Internal Failure: $&quot;, format(internal_failure, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;(&quot;, round(internal_failure/total_coq*100, 1), &quot;%)\\n&quot;) ## Internal Failure: $ 150,000 ( 30 %) cat(&quot;External Failure: $&quot;, format(external_failure, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;(&quot;, round(external_failure/total_coq*100, 1), &quot;%)\\n&quot;) ## External Failure: $ 165,000 ( 33 %) cat(&quot;─────────────────────────────\\n&quot;) ## ───────────────────────────── cat(&quot;Total COQ: $&quot;, format(total_coq, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Total COQ: $ 5e+05 cat(&quot;COQ % of Revenue:&quot;, round(total_coq/revenue*100, 1), &quot;%\\n\\n&quot;) ## COQ % of Revenue: 6.2 % conformance &lt;- prevention + appraisal nonconformance &lt;- internal_failure + external_failure cat(&quot;Conformance Costs: $&quot;, format(conformance, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;(&quot;, round(conformance/total_coq*100, 1), &quot;%)\\n&quot;) ## Conformance Costs: $ 185,000 ( 37 %) cat(&quot;Nonconformance Costs: $&quot;, format(nonconformance, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;(&quot;, round(nonconformance/total_coq*100, 1), &quot;%)\\n&quot;) ## Nonconformance Costs: $ 315,000 ( 63 %) Analysis: - COQ at 7.5% of revenue is HIGH (target &lt;3%) - External failure costs are the largest category (27.5%) - Nonconformance costs (60.8%) greatly exceed conformance (39.2%) - Prevention is only 10% of COQ - very low Recommendations: 1. Increase Prevention Investment: - Implement SPC on critical processes to reduce defects - Enhance operator training on quality standards - Apply PFMEA to identify and control failure modes Reduce External Failures: Analyze warranty data for root causes Improve final inspection effectiveness Implement containment for known issues Optimize Appraisal: Use SPC to reduce inspection where processes are capable Implement risk-based inspection (more for critical, less for proven) Target COQ Reduction: Short-term: Reduce external failures by 50% ($82,500 savings) Medium-term: Reduce internal failures by 30% ($45,000 savings) Long-term: Achieve COQ &lt;3% of revenue ($240,000) Question 7: What is risk-based thinking in ISO 9001:2015? How is it different from formal risk management? Answer: Risk-Based Thinking in ISO 9001:2015: Risk-based thinking is a way of considering risks and opportunities when designing, implementing, and operating the QMS. It: Applies throughout the standard (not a separate clause) Is proportional to potential impact on conformity Makes preventive action part of routine planning Considers both risks (negative) and opportunities (positive) Where Risk-Based Thinking Applies: Clause Application 4.1 Context Identify external/internal issues affecting QMS 4.2 Interested Parties Understand requirements that could impact quality 6.1 Planning Plan actions to address risks and opportunities 8.1 Operations Consider risks in operational planning 9.1 Performance Monitor effectiveness of risk actions 10.2 Corrective Action Update risks/opportunities based on nonconformities How It Differs from Formal Risk Management: Aspect Risk-Based Thinking Formal Risk Management Requirement Implicit throughout ISO 9001 Explicit (ISO 31000) Documentation No formal risk register required Documented risk register Methodology No specific method required Defined methodology (FMEA, etc.) Quantification Not required Often quantitative Scope QMS processes Enterprise-wide Practical Implementation: Organizations should: 1. Consider risks when designing processes 2. Build controls proportional to risk level 3. Monitor and review effectiveness 4. Update as context changes ISO 9001 does NOT require: - Formal risk management process - Risk register - Specific risk assessment methodology - Documented risk assessments (unless organization decides to) However, many organizations do use tools like PFMEA to fulfill risk-based thinking requirements, especially in automotive (IATF 16949 requires it). Question 8: Describe what management review is and what should be included in the inputs and outputs. Answer: What is Management Review? Management review is a formal, periodic evaluation of the QMS by top management to: - Ensure continuing suitability (appropriate for the organization) - Ensure adequacy (sufficient to meet requirements) - Ensure effectiveness (achieving intended results) - Ensure alignment with strategic direction - Identify improvement opportunities Frequency: At least annually; many organizations conduct quarterly reviews Required Inputs (ISO 9001 Clause 9.3.2): Input What to Review Status of previous actions Actions from prior reviews - completed? effective? Changes in external/internal issues Market changes, regulations, technology, organizational changes QMS performance and effectiveness Customer satisfaction, quality objectives, process performance, nonconformities, audit results, supplier performance Resource adequacy People, infrastructure, environment, knowledge Effectiveness of risk actions Did actions address risks/opportunities? Improvement opportunities Suggestions, benchmarking, new technologies Required Outputs (ISO 9001 Clause 9.3.3): Output Examples Improvement decisions Launch specific improvement projects, address recurring issues QMS changes Revise quality objectives, update processes, modify documentation Resource needs Budget approvals, hiring, equipment purchases, training Best Practices: - Use a standard agenda aligned with required inputs - Prepare data in advance (dashboards, trend charts) - Document decisions and action items with owners and due dates - Follow up on action completion - Keep minutes as quality records Evidence Required: - Meeting minutes or management review report - Attendance record (top management participation) - Action items with status tracking - Data/reports presented 14.15 References ISO 9001:2015.

welding Accuracy Ability to reach a commanded position exactly ±0.1 to ±1.0 mm Important for offline programming Maximum Speed Maximum velocity at tool center point or joint speeds 1-12 m/s TCP; 100-500°/s joint Affects cycle time;

Understanding the Difference Repeatability: - Ability to return to the SAME taught position - More important for most applications - Quoted spec (e.g., ±0.05mm) is typically 3σ - Achieved through consistent mechanical design and servo control Accuracy: - Ability to reach a COMMANDED position - Important for offline programming - Affected by mechanical tolerances, deflection, calibration - Can be improved through calibration Why Repeatability Matters More: In most applications, the robot is taught positions by jogging to them. As long as it returns to those positions consistently (repeatability), accuracy doesn’t matter. Accuracy only matters when positions are calculated (offline programming) rather than taught. 15.5 Robot System Components A complete robotic system consists of several integrated components. 15.5.1 System Architecture 15.5.2 End Effectors (EOAT) End of Arm Tooling (EOAT) is the device attached to the robot’s wrist to interact with parts.

For each, describe the typical applications and key advantages. Answer: Robot Type Configuration Key Advantages Typical Applications 6-Axis Articulated 6 revolute joints; human-like arm Maximum flexibility; can reach any orientation; large payload range Welding, painting, assembly, material handling, machine tending SCARA 4 axes; selective compliance Very fast horizontal motion; rigid vertical; compact; precise Pick-and-place, assembly, screw driving, packaging Delta (Parallel) 3-4 axes; parallel linkage Extremely fast (150+ picks/min); low moving mass High-speed picking, packaging, sorting, light assembly Detailed Comparison: 6-Axis Articulated: - Most versatile - can position tool at any angle - Wide payload range (3 kg to 2300+ kg) - Can reach around obstacles - Complex programming possible - Best for: Tasks requiring complex orientations, welding seams, painting SCARA: - Inherently rigid in Z (vertical) - good for insertion - Very fast in X-Y plane - Lower cost than 6-axis - Compact footprint - Best for: Assembly operations, circuit board population, packaging Delta: - Highest speed of any configuration - Low inertia (motors at base, not moving) - Limited payload (typically &lt;15 kg) - Requires overhead mounting - Best for: High-speed sorting, packaging lines, food handling Question 2: A robot has a maximum payload of 15 kg. The gripper weighs 4 kg and the part weighs 8 kg. Is this robot suitable? What other factors should be considered? Answer: Initial Assessment: Total load = Gripper weight + Part weight Total load = 4 kg + 8 kg = 12 kg Robot capacity: 15 kg Load: 12 kg Remaining margin: 3 kg (20%) Consideration with Safety Factor: Typical safety factor: 1.2 - 1.5 Required capacity = 12 kg × 1.25 = 15 kg This equals the robot&#39;s maximum capacity - marginal! Additional Factors to Consider: Moment Load (Torque at Wrist) Distance from flange to center of gravity matters If part is held 300mm from flange: Moment = 8 kg × 0.3 m = 2.4 kg·m Robot specs include moment limits - must verify Inertia Fast motion requires acceleration Higher mass + longer distance = higher inertia May need to derate payload for high-speed applications Payload Derating with Reach Many robots derate payload at extended reach 15 kg at 500mm may become 10 kg at 1500mm Check payload diagram in robot specifications Orientation Payload may vary with wrist orientation Horizontal reach vs. vertical lift differ Acceleration Requirements Higher acceleration = higher effective load May need to reduce speed/acceleration Recommendation: The 15 kg robot is marginal for this application. Consider: - Select next size up (20 kg) for adequate margin - Use lighter gripper (3 kg or less) - Reduce part handling distance from flange - Limit acceleration/speed if using this robot Question 3: Explain the difference between repeatability and accuracy. Why is repeatability often more important than accuracy for robot applications? Answer: Definitions: Repeatability: - Ability to return to the same taught position multiple times - Measures consistency/precision of motion - Quoted as ± value (e.g., ±0.05 mm at 3σ) - Affected by: mechanical wear, servo control, thermal effects Accuracy: - Ability to reach a commanded position exactly - Measures how close actual position is to theoretical position - Typically worse than repeatability (e.g., ±0.5 mm) - Affected by: manufacturing tolerances, calibration, deflection, backlash Why Repeatability is Usually More Important: Teaching Method Most robots are programmed by teaching (jogging to positions) Robot doesn’t need to know where it “should” be - just return to where it was taught As long as it returns consistently (repeatability), accuracy doesn’t matter Process Requirements Welding: Need to follow same seam every time → repeatability Assembly: Need to insert part in same hole every time → repeatability Pick-place: Need to pick from same fixture position → repeatability Compensation Possible Poor accuracy can be compensated by adjusting taught points Poor repeatability cannot be compensated When Accuracy Matters: Offline Programming Positions calculated from CAD data, not taught Robot must go where commanded, first time Common in aerospace (large parts, tight access) Multi-Robot Systems Robots must agree on positions Calibration to common frame requires accuracy Frequent Program Changes If programs are frequently changed without re-teaching Offline modifications need accurate execution Bottom Line: For most industrial applications, ±0.05 mm repeatability is far more valuable than ±0.5 mm accuracy because taught positions are used. Question 4: Describe the four collaborative operation modes defined in ISO/TS 15066. Give an example application for each. Answer: 1. Safety-Rated Monitored Stop Description: Robot operates at normal speed when workspace is clear. When a person enters the collaborative zone, the robot stops and holds position. Robot resumes automatically when person exits. Technical Requirements: - Safety-rated sensors (light curtains, scanners) - Safety-rated monitored stop function - Clearly defined collaborative zone Example Application: Machine tending cell where operator occasionally loads raw material. Robot works at full speed during machining cycle but stops safely when operator enters to load/unload. 2. Hand Guiding Description: Operator physically contacts the robot through a hand guiding device and manually moves it. Robot follows operator’s force input. Technical Requirements: - Hand guiding device (force/torque sensing) - Emergency stop accessible at guiding device - Speed reduction while guiding - Safe torque control Example Application: Teaching a paint path on an aerospace component. Operator guides robot along surface contour while robot records positions. Also used for “collaborative finishing” where operator guides robot holding a polishing tool. 3. Speed and Separation Monitoring Description: Robot continuously monitors distance to the nearest person. Speed adjusts based on separation: full speed when far, reduced speed when closer, stop if minimum distance breached. Technical Requirements: - Safety-rated distance monitoring (usually area scanners) - Safety-rated speed control - Multiple speed/distance zones defined - Real-time separation calculation Example Application: Shared packaging area where robot palletizes cases while operator moves around the cell. Robot slows when operator approaches, stops if too close, and resumes at appropriate speed as operator moves away. 4. Power and Force Limiting Description: Robot is designed so that forces and pressures from any contact are below injury thresholds. Contact is allowed because it cannot cause harm. Technical Requirements: - Inherently safe design (compliant joints, low mass, rounded surfaces) - Force/torque sensing or current monitoring - Verified force limits per ISO/TS 15066 body area tables - May include padding/soft covers Example Application: Assembly assist where robot holds a heavy part while human worker installs fasteners. Robot and human are in direct contact, with robot providing position support and human providing dexterity. Force is limited so accidental contact causes no injury. Question 5: Calculate the required gripper force for a robot picking a 2 kg part with a friction coefficient of 0.4. The robot accelerates at 10 m/s². Use a safety factor of 2.0.

Characteristics: - Rigid construction (steel, aluminum, polycarbonate) - Must withstand expected impact forces - Minimum height (typically ≥1.8 m) - Properly anchored to floor - May include interlocked gates for authorized entry Application: Primary safeguard for most traditional robot cells. 2. Light Curtains (AOPD - Active Opto-electronic Protective Device) Description: Transmitter and receiver create a sensing field of infrared beams. Breaking any beam triggers a stop. Characteristics: - Type 2 or Type 4 (safety-rated) - Resolution (14mm for finger, 40mm for hand/arm) - Muting capability for material transfer - Very fast response (&lt;20ms) Application: Access points where frequent entry needed; allows material flow while protecting personnel. 3. Safety Mats (Pressure-Sensitive Mats) Description: Floor mats that detect weight/pressure and trigger stop when stepped on. Characteristics: - Placed in hazardous zones - Withstand industrial environment (oil, debris) - Fast response - Self-monitoring for failures Application: Areas where overhead detection isn’t practical; around robot bases. 4. Area Scanners (Safety Laser Scanners) Description: Laser scanner detects objects/personnel entering defined zones. Multiple warning and stop zones configurable. Characteristics: - 270° field of view typical - Multiple programmable zones - Warning zone (slow robot) and stop zone (stop robot) - Type 3 safety rating - Detects at floor level Application: Open cells requiring flexibility; mobile robot protection; speed/separation monitoring. 5. Interlocked Gates/Doors Description: Access gates with safety switches that stop robot when opened. Characteristics: - Mechanical or magnetic interlock switches - Trapped key systems for lockout - May include guard locking (prevent opening while robot moving) - Escape release from inside - Meets ISO 14119 Application: Authorized entry points for maintenance, setup, troubleshooting. Additional Devices: E-Stop (Emergency Stop): Palm-operated buttons to immediately stop robot Two-Hand Controls: Require both hands on buttons to initiate motion Enabling Devices: 3-position switches held by personnel in restricted area Presence-Sensing Devices: Capacitive, radar, or vision-based detection Question 7: Explain the difference between MoveJ (Joint Move) and MoveL (Linear Move). When would you use each? Answer: MoveJ (Joint Move) How It Works: - Each joint moves from start to end angle independently - All joints start and stop together (coordinated) - Path of TCP (Tool Center Point) is unpredictable - curved - Robot calculates joint interpolation, not TCP path Characteristics: - Fastest point-to-point motion - No singularity issues during move - Path may vary depending on starting configuration - Speed specified in % of max or joint velocity (°/s) When to Use: - Moving between distant points through free space - Approach movements before precise positioning - Home position moves - Any time when path doesn’t matter, only endpoints - Escaping from near-singularity positions MoveL (Linear Move) How It Works: - TCP follows a straight line from start to end - Robot calculates joint positions to maintain linear TCP path - Orientation is interpolated linearly as well - All axes coordinated to produce straight line Characteristics: - Guaranteed straight path - Consistent, predictable motion - Slower than MoveJ for same endpoint distance - Can encounter singularities during move - Speed specified in mm/s at TCP When to Use: - Process paths (welding, sealing, cutting) - Insertion/extraction operations - Approach to pick/place positions - Any time path must be straight - When moving close to obstacles Practical Example: Imagine picking a part from a fixture: ! Move from home to near pick position - path doesn&#39;t matter MoveJ pApproach, v1000, z50, tool1 ! Joint move - fast ! Move down to pick - must be straight to avoid collision MoveL pPick, v100, fine, tool1 ! Linear move - controlled ! Pick part, then retract straight up GripperClose() MoveL pApproach, v200, z10, tool1 ! Linear move - straight up ! Move to place area - through open space MoveJ pPlaceApproach, v1000, z50, tool1 ! Joint move - fast Key Decision: - If path matters → MoveL - If only destination matters → MoveJ Question 8: A manufacturing engineer needs to select a robot for a palletizing application. The requirements are: 25 kg payload, 2.2 m horizontal reach, 10 cycles per minute, floor-mounted. Recommend a robot type and justify your selection. Answer: Application Analysis: Requirement Value Implication Payload 25 kg Medium-heavy; rules out delta and most SCARA Reach 2.2 m Large work envelope needed Cycle rate 10/min 6 seconds/cycle; moderate speed Mounting Floor Typical industrial installation Motion type Palletizing Mainly vertical and horizontal; some rotation Robot Type Evaluation: 1. 4-Axis Palletizing Robot (RECOMMENDED) - Specifically designed for palletizing - 4 axes: base rotation, arm, elbow, wrist - High payload capability (25-700+ kg available) - Long reach available (up to 3.2m) - Fast for palletizing motions - Lower cost than 6-axis - Examples: FANUC M-410iC, KUKA KR QUANTEC PA, ABB IRB 460 Verdict: Excellent match for this application 2. 6-Axis Articulated Robot - Maximum flexibility - Can handle complex pallet patterns - Higher cost than 4-axis for same payload - May be over-specified for simple palletizing - Examples: FANUC M-710iC/50, ABB IRB 6700 Verdict: Capable but potentially over-specified and more expensive 3. Cartesian/Gantry Robot - Can cover very large areas - Simple motion control - Higher installation complexity - Less common for palletizing applications Verdict: Possible but not ideal for this payload/cycle rate Recommended Selection: FANUC M-410iC/185 or similar 4-axis palletizer - Payload: 185 kg (well above 25 kg requirement with margin for gripper) - Reach: 3.143 m (exceeds 2.2 m requirement) - Repeatability: ±0.5 mm - Axes: 4 Justification: 1. Purpose-built: Designed specifically for palletizing 2. Adequate payload: 185 kg allows for heavy gripper + multiple parts 3. Reach: 3.1 m provides margin for future needs 4. Speed: Optimized kinematics for palletizing motion profile 5. Reliability: Proven in thousands of palletizing applications 6. Cost: Lower than equivalent 6-axis robot 7. Simplicity: 4 axes easier to program and maintain than 6 Additional Recommendations: - Vacuum or mechanical gripper depending on product - Vision system for product detection if variety exists - Safety scanner for operator access during pallet changes - Interface to conveyor for product delivery 15.14 References Siciliano, B., &amp; Khatib, O.

According to research, AI is predominantly used for coding and technical work (34% of professional use), with complex tasks showing potential 12x speedups compared to traditional methods. However, there’s a critical paradox: more complex tasks have lower success rates (61-66% versus 70% for simpler tasks). This means engineers must develop skills to effectively collaborate with AI, not just delegate to it. 16.2.1 The Education Paradox Key Insight: There is a nearly perfect correlation between prompt sophistication and response quality. You need strong foundational knowledge to get quality AI assistance. “AI will do it for me” is a trap. 16.2.2 AI Impact by Industry Table 16.1: Table 16.2: AI Impact Across Engineering Industries Industry Common AI Applications Potential Speedup Success Rate Human Oversight Needed Automotive Simulation modeling, control systems, predictive maintenance 10-12x 62% Critical Food Processing Process optimization, quality control, equipment diagnostics 8-10x 68% High Defense System design, modeling, compliance documentation 10-12x 61% Critical Mining Equipment diagnostics, predictive maintenance, safety analysis 8-10x 65% High General Manufacturing Documentation, troubleshooting guides, process analysis 6-8x 70% Moderate 16.3 Prompt Engineering Fundamentals Prompt engineering is the skill of crafting inputs to AI systems that produce useful, accurate, and relevant outputs. In engineering contexts, this skill is becoming as important as technical writing. 16.3.1 The Seven Rules of Effective Prompts 16.4 Prompt Quality Comparison: Bad, Medium, and Good The following examples demonstrate the dramatic difference that prompt quality makes. Each example shows the same task approached three ways. 16.4.1 Example 1: Motor Selection Table 16.3: Table 16.4: Motor Selection Prompt Comparison Quality Level Prompt Expected AI Response Bad Help me pick a motor. Generic motor types list with no specific guidance. AI cannot determine application, size, or requirements. Medium I need to select a motor for a conveyor system. The conveyor moves boxes that weigh up to 50kg. What motor should I use? Basic motor power estimate, general motor types suggested, but missing: duty cycle, environment, power supply, efficiency requirements, safety factors. Good Act as a senior electromechanical engineer. I need to select an AC induction motor for a conveyor belt system with the following specifications:- Load: cardboard boxes up to 50kg each- Belt speed: 0.5 m/s- Belt length: 10m, width: 0.6m- Incline: 5 degrees- Operating environment: food processing plant (IP65 required)- Power supply: 480V 3-phaseprovide:. Required torque calculation. Motor power recommendation with 25% safety factor. Recommended motor specifications (frame size, efficiency class). Three specific motor models from major manufacturers. Mounting considerationsas a technical memo with calculations shown. Complete technical analysis with calculated torque (~85 Nm), motor sizing (1.5-2.2 kW), specific model recommendations (e.g., ABB M3BP, Siemens 1LE1), IP65-rated food-safe options, and mounting specifications. 16.4.2 Example 2: Troubleshooting a PLC System Table 16.5: Table 16.6: PLC Troubleshooting Prompt Comparison Quality Level Prompt Why This Works (or Doesn’t) Bad My PLC isn’t working. Fix it. No context: What PLC? What’s the symptom? What have you tried? AI will give generic advice that wastes time. Medium I have an Allen-Bradley PLC that’s showing a fault. The output for a motor starter isn’t turning on even though the program shows it should be. What could be wrong? Better: Identifies equipment and basic symptom. Missing: specific I/O addresses, what’s been checked, system configuration, urgency. Good Act as an experienced automation technician troubleshooting a control system issue.: Allen-Bradley CompactLogix L33ER: Output O:2/5 (motor starter for pump P-101) fails to energize:- Rung logic in RSLogix shows OTE instruction is TRUE- Output status LED on I/O module is OFF- Motor starter coil tests good (24VDC, 85 ohms)- Other outputs on same module work correctly- Problem started after yesterday’s power outageprovide:. Systematic troubleshooting steps in order of likelihood. How to test each potential failure point. Safety precautions for each test. Possible root causes ranked by probability. Preventive measures to avoid recurrenceas a troubleshooting checklist I can use in the field. Excellent: Provides complete context, specific observations, clear deliverables, and practical output format. Enables targeted, actionable response. 16.4.3 Example 3: Safety Analysis Table 16.7: Table 16.8: Safety Analysis Prompt Comparison - Critical Application Quality Level Prompt Risk Assessment Bad Is this machine safe? DANGEROUS: Vague prompts about safety can lead to incomplete analysis and missed hazards. Never acceptable for safety-critical work. Medium I have a robotic welding cell. What safety features does it need? INADEQUATE: Will get generic safety device list but miss application-specific hazards, risk levels, and compliance requirements. Good Act as a certified machine safety engineer (TUV or equivalent).need to perform a risk assessment for a new robotic welding cell with the following configuration:- Robot: FANUC ArcMate 100iD, 12kg payload- Process: MIG welding, automotive brackets- Cell size: 4m x 4m- Operator tasks: Load/unload parts every 45 seconds- Adjacent to manual assembly line (2m clearance)provide:. Hazard identification using ISO 12100 categories. Risk assessment matrix for top 5 hazards. Required safeguarding per OSHA and ISO 10218-2. Recommended safety system architecture. Validation testing requirementsapplicable standards (ISO, ANSI/RIA, CSA) for each recommendation. APPROPRIATE: Enables comprehensive, standards-based response. Still requires human expert validation before implementation. Warning: For safety-critical applications, AI should NEVER be the final authority. Always validate AI-generated safety analyses with certified professionals and applicable standards. 16.5 Anatomy of an Excellent Engineering Prompt Let’s break down the components of a well-structured prompt: 16.6 Interactive Exercise: Rate These Prompts For each prompt below, identify what’s missing and how you would improve it. 16.6.1 Exercise 1: Pump Selection Original Prompt: “What pump should I use for water?” Table 16.9: Table 16.10: Analysis: What’s Missing from This Prompt? Missing Element Why It’s Important Flow rate requirement Cannot size pump without knowing GPM or L/min needed Head/pressure requirement Total dynamic head determines pump curve selection Fluid properties Temperature, viscosity, solids content affect pump type Operating environment Indoor/outdoor, hazardous area, food-grade requirements Power supply Single/three phase, voltage determines motor options Budget/efficiency goals Premium efficiency vs. standard, capital vs. operating cost Your Task: Rewrite this prompt to include all necessary information for a food processing application pumping tomato paste at 80°C. 16.6.2 Exercise 2: Identify the Quality Level Rate each prompt as Bad, Medium, or Good and justify your rating: Table 16.11: Table 16.12: Exercise: Rate These Prompts # Prompt Your Rating (B/M/G) Justification 1 How do I wire a motor? ________ ________ 2 Explain the difference between VFD and soft starter for a 50HP motor application in a cement plant with high dust. ________ ________ 3 Write code for Arduino. ________ ________ 4 Design a sensor network for predictive maintenance on a CNC machine. Include vibration, temperature, and current sensors with sampling rates and communication protocol recommendations. ________ ________ 5 Help with my project. ________ ________ 16.7 The Four Steps of Effective AI Use The research shows that effectively working with AI follows a consistent four-step process. Master these steps to maximize the value of AI collaboration. 16.7.1 Step 1: Define the Task Before engaging with AI, clearly define what you need: What is the end goal? A calculation, a design, troubleshooting guidance? What constraints apply? Budget, standards, materials, timeline? What do you already know? Your expertise shapes the conversation Can AI actually help with this? Some tasks require physical inspection or human judgment Key Insight: The better you understand the problem, the better AI can help. Vague understanding leads to vague prompts and useless responses. 16.7.2 Step 2: Prompt with Context Apply the seven rules of effective prompting: Assign a role to establish expertise level Provide complete context and background Specify constraints and requirements List clear deliverables Request step-by-step reasoning Define the output format Include relevant standards 16.7.3 Step 3: Iterate and Refine Rarely is the first response perfect. Plan for 3-6 turns of conversation: Review critically: What’s useful? What’s missing? What’s wrong? Ask targeted follow-up questions Request expansions on specific areas Challenge assumptions and ask for alternatives 16.7.4 Step 4: Validate and Apply AI output is a starting point, not a final answer: Verify calculations and units Cross-check against standards and codes Apply your engineering judgment Document what came from AI assistance Take responsibility for the final work product 16.8 AI Tools and Their Use Cases Different AI tools serve different purposes. Understanding when to use each tool maximizes productivity. 16.8.1 Chat Interfaces (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini) Web-based conversational AI platforms are the most versatile starting point for AI collaboration. Table 16.13: Table 16.14: Common Engineering Use Cases for Chat Interfaces Use Case Description Example Prompt Technical Explanations Explain complex concepts, standards, or technical principles in accessible terms ‘Explain the difference between ASIL levels in ISO 26262 for automotive safety’ Document Drafting Draft reports, specifications, procedures, or technical memos ‘Draft a preventive maintenance procedure for a hydraulic press’ Calculation Verification Double-check hand calculations; request step-by-step solutions ‘Verify my torque calculation: 50kg load, 0.3m arm, need Nm result’ Brainstorming Solutions Generate alternative approaches to engineering problems ‘What are three approaches to detect bearing wear before failure?’ Code Generation Write PLC ladder logic concepts, Python scripts, or MATLAB code ‘Write Python code to calculate conveyor belt speed from encoder pulses’ Standard Interpretation Interpret requirements from ISO, OSHA, NEC, or other standards ‘What does NFPA 70E require for arc flash labeling on electrical panels?’ Best Practices for Chat Interfaces: Start new conversations for new topics (avoid context pollution) Use the “regenerate” feature to see alternative responses Upload images of diagrams, schematics, or equipment for visual analysis Copy important responses to notes (conversations can be lost) 16.8.2 NotebookLM (Google) NotebookLM is specifically designed for source-grounded research. Upload documents, and the AI answers questions based only on your sources. Table 16.15: Table 16.16: NotebookLM Features for Engineering Work Feature Description Engineering Application Source-Based Answers Answers come directly from your uploaded documents, reducing hallucination Upload equipment manuals and ask specific troubleshooting questions Citation Links Every answer includes clickable citations to the exact source passage Verify AI claims against original standards documents Audio Overview Generates AI podcast-style audio summaries of your documents for learning Listen to safety standard summaries during commute or shop floor time Multi-Document Synthesis Combines information from multiple PDFs, websites, or text files Compare multiple vendor datasheets or competing standards Note Generation Creates structured notes and summaries from source materials Generate study guides from technical documentation Example NotebookLM Workflow: Upload: ISO 12100, ISO 13849-1, equipment manual PDF Ask: “What risk assessment steps does ISO 12100 require?” Review: AI provides answer with direct citations to document sections Generate: Create an audio overview to reinforce learning When to Use NotebookLM: When you need answers grounded in specific documents rather than general AI knowledge. Ideal for standards compliance, equipment documentation, and research synthesis. 16.8.3 Claude Code (Command Line Tool) Claude Code is a terminal-based AI assistant that can read, write, and execute code in your actual project environment. Table 16.17: Table 16.18: Claude Code Capabilities for Technical Work Capability Description Example File Operations Read, write, and edit files directly in your project Edit src/motor_control.py to add speed ramping Code Development Generate, refactor, and debug code with full context Write a Python script to parse PLC data logs Command Execution Run build commands, tests, and system tools Run pytest and fix any failing tests Project Context Understands your entire codebase structure Find all files that reference the ‘Pump’ class Git Integration Create commits, branches, and pull requests Commit changes with descriptive message Engineering Applications: PLC Code Analysis: Review and understand legacy ladder logic or structured text Data Processing: Create scripts to analyze production data, SPC charts, or sensor logs Documentation Generation: Auto-generate code documentation or API references Test Automation: Write unit tests for engineering calculations Example Session: &gt; claude &quot;Analyze the motor_control.py file and suggest improvements for handling encoder signal noise&quot; Claude Code reads the file, understands the context, and provides specific recommendations with code changes that can be applied directly. 16.8.4 Browser Extensions (Claude Extension, etc.) Browser extensions provide instant AI assistance without leaving your current workflow. Table 16.19: Table 16.20: Browser Extension Use Cases Use Case How It Helps Example Webpage Summarization Summarize long technical articles or datasheets instantly On a 20-page motor datasheet: ‘What is the rated torque at 1750 RPM?’ Technical Documentation Ask questions about the documentation page you’re reading On Allen-Bradley KB: ‘How do I configure this fault code?’ Email Composition Draft professional responses to technical inquiries ‘Help me respond professionally to this RFQ’ Research Assistance Explain unfamiliar terms or concepts on any webpage Highlight text: ‘Explain MTBF in practical terms’ Quick Calculations Get quick engineering calculations without switching apps ‘Convert 150 lb-ft to Nm’ Best Practices: Use for quick queries and summaries For complex problems, move to a full chat interface Be cautious with confidential information on web pages Extensions work best for reading comprehension tasks 16.8.5 Choosing the Right Tool Table 16.21: Table 16.22: Tool Selection Quick Reference Situation Best Tool Why Need to understand a technical concept Chat Interface Flexible conversation, can explore related topics Writing code for a project Claude Code Can directly modify files and run tests Researching from specific documents NotebookLM Answers grounded in your source documents Quick question about a webpage Browser Extension No context switching, immediate assistance Drafting technical documentation Chat Interface Good at structured document generation Analyzing production data Claude Code Can write and execute analysis scripts Learning new standards NotebookLM (with audio) Audio overviews for passive learning 16.9 The Iterative Approach: Multi-Turn AI Collaboration Complex engineering problems are rarely solved in a single prompt. The iterative approach mirrors how you would work with a human expert. 16.9.1 The Iteration Cycle 16.9.2 Worked Example: Designing a Conveyor Control System Turn 1 - Initial Prompt: Act as an automation engineer. Design a basic control system for a conveyor belt in a packaging line. The conveyor is 15m long and transports boxes to a palletizing station. AI Response Summary: Generic overview with basic motor control, start/stop logic, and simple sensors. Turn 2 - Adding Specificity: Good start. Now expand with these details: - Add accumulation zones (3 zones, 5m each) with photo-eye sensors - Include a reject station at the 10m mark for overweight boxes - Integrate with an upstream case sealer (need handshake signals) - Use Allen-Bradley CompactLogix as the controller Show the I/O list and basic ladder logic structure. AI Response Summary: Detailed I/O list, zone control logic, sensor placement, and communication requirements. Turn 3 - Safety and Edge Cases: Now address: 1. What happens if the downstream palletizer faults? 2. Add E-stop integration per ISO 13849 PLd requirements 3. How do we handle box jams in each zone? 4. What&#39;s the startup sequence after E-stop reset? Include safety relay wiring diagram description. AI Response Summary: Complete safety integration, fault handling, jam detection, and recovery procedures. Turn 4 - Final Validation: Review your complete design and: 1. List any assumptions you made that I should verify 2. Identify potential failure modes you haven&#39;t addressed 3. What information would you need to finalize this for implementation? 4. Are there any code standards (ISA, IEC) I should reference? AI Response Summary: Comprehensive assumption list, remaining questions, and standards references for documentation. Key Point: This four-turn conversation produced a design that would have required a much longer single prompt to achieve, and the iterative approach allowed for course correction along the way. 16.10 Practice Topics for Iterative AI Sessions Use these topics to practice the iterative approach. Each topic is designed to require multiple turns to fully develop. 16.10.1 Beginner Level Table 16.23: Table 16.24: Beginner Practice Topics Topic Iteration Hint Expected Turns Motor Starter Selection Start with application, then add environment, protection requirements, control method 2-3 Sensor Selection for Proximity Detection Begin with what you’re detecting, then material, distance, environment, output type 2-3 Basic PLC Program for Traffic Light Define sequence first, then timing, then inputs/outputs, then safety 3-4 Belt Conveyor Speed Calculation Start with throughput requirement, then add physical constraints 2-3 16.10.2 Intermediate Level Table 16.25: Table 16.26: Intermediate Practice Topics Topic Iteration Hint Expected Turns VFD Parameter Setup for Pump Application Define motor and load first, then control requirements, then protection settings 3-4 PFMEA for Automated Assembly Station Describe process steps, then potential failures, then iterate on severity/occurrence ratings 4-5 Pneumatic Circuit Design with Safety Start with actuator requirements, then add safety, then valve selection, then circuit 3-4 HMI Screen Layout for Batch Process Define operator tasks first, then alarms, then navigation, then data display 3-4 16.10.3 Advanced Level Table 16.27: Table 16.28: Advanced Practice Topics Topic Iteration Hint Expected Turns Predictive Maintenance System Architecture Define assets and failure modes, then sensors, then data architecture, then analytics approach 5-6 Robot Cell Integration with Vision System Robot selection first, then vision requirements, then communication, then programming approach 5-6 Energy Management System for Manufacturing Plant Start with loads and usage patterns, then monitoring points, then control strategy, then ROI 4-5 Complete Machine Safety Assessment Describe machine function, then hazards, then risk assessment, then safeguarding, then validation 5-6 16.11 Critical Evaluation of AI Outputs AI can produce confident-sounding responses that are completely wrong. Engineers must develop critical evaluation skills. 16.11.1 Red Flags in AI Responses Table 16.29: Table 16.30: Red Flags in AI-Generated Engineering Content Red Flag Example Your Response Calculations Without Units “The motor needs 150” - 150 what? HP? kW? Nm? Always request calculations with units shown; verify dimensional analysis Missing Safety Considerations Design has no E-stop, no guarding discussion, no lockout provisions Explicitly ask for safety analysis; cross-reference with standards Outdated Standards Referenced References NEC 2014 when 2023 is current; cites withdrawn ISO standards Verify all standard references; check publication dates Overconfident Language “This will definitely work” or “This is the only solution” Be skeptical; request alternatives and trade-offs Generic Without Specifics “Use appropriate sensors” without specifying type, range, or model Push for specific part numbers, ranges, and specifications Ignoring Stated Constraints You specified 24VDC and AI designs for 120VAC Re-state constraints clearly; verify compliance in response 16.11.2 Verification Checklist Before using any AI-generated engineering content: Table 16.31: Table 16.32: AI Output Verification Checklist Category Verification Item Verified Calculations Calculations All calculations include units [ ] Calculations Results are dimensionally consistent [ ] Calculations Order of magnitude is reasonable [ ] Standards Compliance Standards Referenced standards are current versions [ ] Standards Applicable regional codes are addressed (NEC, CSA, IEC) [ ] Safety Safety All identified hazards have mitigation [ ] Safety Failure modes are considered [ ] Safety Human factors are addressed [ ] Practical Implementation Practical Specified components are available/not obsolete [ ] Practical Cost and lead time are realistic [ ] 16.12 When NOT to Use AI AI is a tool, not a replacement for engineering judgment. Recognize its limitations. 16.12.1 AI Excels At: Generating first drafts and starting points Explaining concepts and standards Creating documentation templates Performing routine calculations (with verification) Suggesting troubleshooting approaches Comparing options and trade-offs 16.12.2 AI Struggles With: Table 16.33: Table 16.34: Tasks Requiring Human Engineering Judgment Limitation Description Example Site-Specific Context AI doesn’t know your plant layout, existing equipment, or local practices Recommending motor location without knowing available floor space or cable routes Current Conditions AI cannot inspect, measure, or observe actual equipment conditions Cannot diagnose bearing wear by sound or vibration feel Ethical Judgment Decisions balancing safety, cost, and risk require human judgment Choosing between immediate shutdown vs. controlled stop with production impact Novel Situations Unprecedented problems may not have training data to draw from First-of-kind machine with no similar designs to reference Physical Intuition Experience-based intuition about what ‘feels wrong’ in a machine Recognizing that a pump ‘doesn’t sound right’ before instruments show a problem Accountability AI cannot stamp drawings, sign off on safety, or take legal responsibility A P.Eng. must review and approve critical designs; AI cannot be licensed 16.13 Ethical Considerations Using AI in engineering work carries professional and ethical responsibilities. 16.13.1 Key Principles Transparency: Disclose AI assistance where required by professional standards or employer policy Verification: Never submit AI-generated work as final without verification by qualified personnel Accountability: You remain responsible for work product regardless of AI assistance Confidentiality: Do not input proprietary designs, client data, or trade secrets into public AI systems Competence: AI assistance does not substitute for required qualifications or experience 16.13.2 Industry-Specific Considerations Table 16.35: Table 16.36: Industry-Specific AI Ethics Considerations Industry Key Ethical/Legal Concern Guidance Automotive Functional safety (ISO 26262) requires traceable human decisions Document AI usage; ensure ASIL requirements met through verification Food Processing Food safety regulations (FDA, CFIA) require validated processes AI can draft HACCP plans but qualified personnel must validate Defense ITAR/export controls may prohibit certain AI tool usage Consult legal/compliance before using AI on controlled projects Mining Worker safety regulations require qualified sign-off P.Eng. or equivalent must review all safety-critical designs 16.14 Hands-On Lab Exercise 16.14.1 Objective Practice the complete AI collaboration workflow on a realistic engineering problem. 16.14.2 Scenario You are tasked with designing an automated inspection station for a food packaging line. The station must: Inspect sealed packages for proper seal integrity Reject packages with defects Track inspection statistics Integrate with existing Allen-Bradley PLC system 16.14.3 Instructions Write your initial prompt (5 minutes) Apply the seven rules of effective prompts Include role, context, specifications, constraints, and deliverables Conduct 3-4 iteration turns (15 minutes) Review each AI response critically Identify gaps and request specific expansions Push for component specifications and safety considerations Evaluate the final output (5 minutes) Use the verification checklist Note any red flags Identify what still requires human expertise Document your process (5 minutes) What worked well in your prompting approach? What would you do differently next time? What human expertise was essential? 16.14.4 Deliverables Initial prompt (graded on structure and completeness) Iteration log showing refinement process Critical evaluation notes Reflection on lessons learned 16.15 Summary 16.15.1 Key Takeaways The Education Paradox: Strong foundational knowledge is required to get quality AI assistance. “AI will do it for me” is a dangerous mindset. The Four Steps: Effective AI use follows a consistent process: Define → Prompt → Iterate → Validate. Skipping steps leads to poor results. Prompt Engineering is a Skill: Like technical writing, crafting effective prompts requires practice and follows learnable principles. Choose the Right Tool: Different AI tools serve different purposes. Chat interfaces for exploration, NotebookLM for source-grounded research, Claude Code for development, and browser extensions for quick assistance. Iteration is Normal: Professional engineers should expect 3-6 turns of AI conversation for complex problems. Critical Evaluation is Essential: AI produces confident-sounding outputs that may be wrong. Verify everything. Human Judgment Remains Central: AI augments but does not replace engineering expertise, especially for safety-critical decisions. 16.16 Review Questions Explain the “education paradox” in AI usage and why it matters for engineering students. List and describe the four steps of effective AI use. Why is each step important? List the seven rules of effective engineering prompts and give an example of each. What are three red flags that should make you question an AI-generated engineering recommendation? Describe the iterative approach to AI collaboration and why single-prompt interactions are often inadequate. Compare and contrast the four main types of AI tools (chat interfaces, NotebookLM, Claude Code, browser extensions). When would you use each? For which types of engineering tasks is AI assistance most appropriate? Least appropriate? What ethical considerations apply when using AI for engineering work in safety-critical industries? Transform this bad prompt into a good prompt: “Help me size a pump.” You need to research a new ISO standard and create a summary for your team. Which AI tool(s) would you use and why? Why is it important to include standards references in engineering prompts? How does NotebookLM differ from general chat interfaces like ChatGPT or Claude.ai? When would this difference matter? 16.17 References and Further Reading Anthropic Economic Index Report (2026) - AI usage patterns in professional work ISO 12100 - Safety of machinery, General principles for design IEC 62443 - Industrial communication networks, Network and system security Professional Engineers Ontario - Use of Artificial Intelligence guidelines OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide - General prompting techniques IEEE Code of Ethics - Professional responsibilities in technology 16.18 Glossary Prompt Engineering: The practice of designing inputs to AI systems to achieve desired outputs. Iteration/Multi-turn Conversation: Using multiple exchanges with AI to progressively refine and improve outputs. Augmentation: Using AI to enhance human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. Automation: Delegating complete tasks to AI with minimal human intervention. Hallucination: AI generating plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. Context Window: The amount of text an AI can consider at once; important for complex problems requiring extensive background. Chat Interface: Web-based conversational AI platforms (e.g., Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini) for flexible, general-purpose AI interaction. NotebookLM: Google’s AI tool that provides source-grounded answers based on uploaded documents, with citation links and audio overview generation. Claude Code: A command-line AI tool that can read, write, and execute code directly in project environments with full file system access. Browser Extension: AI tools integrated into web browsers for instant assistance without switching applications; useful for webpage analysis and quick queries. Source-Grounded AI: AI systems that base responses on specific provided documents rather than general training data, reducing hallucination risk.
