Defining and identifying manufacturing processes is critical to understanding the role that automation plays and how to program an industrial process line. What are some examples of a manufacturing process? What do we have or use that is manufactured? What is the biggest manufacturing change that you have experienced so far? Processes have changed throughout the centuries and have been driven by the four Industrial Revolutions. First Industrial Revolution – Coal in 1765 This transformed society from an agricultural base to an industrial base. Processes became mechanized and rather than hand made, products were manufactured. The discovery of coal and the development of the steam engine and metal forging transformed the way goods were created. Second Industrial Revolution – Gas in 1870 *The discovery of oil and electricity fueled the second industrial revolution. The discovery of oil lead to the invention of the combustion engine and new steel and chemical based products entered the manufacturing streams. Technological advances in communication were driven by the invention of the telegraph and later the telephone. Modes of transportation developed with the invention of the airplane and automobile. These discoveries helped to drive the advent of mass production which forever changed how items were produced. Third Industrial Revolution – Electronics and Nuclear Energy in 1969 The third industrial revolution is dominated by the development of electronics and the beginning of the age of computers. Technological developments were centered around four pillars of science: telecommunications, biotechnology, information technology and energy engineering. Fourth Industrial Revolution – Internet and AI The fourth industrial revolution describes the current era of digitalization, automation, and advanced manufacturing technology. It’s characterized by the convergence of emerging technologies, such as robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 3D printing.

Based on the product requirement there different types of manufacturing processes which are used to get the required output. In this chapter, you are going to learn about the seven types manufacturing processes and their subtypes with examples. Some websites mention four types of manufacturing processes while some mention five types of manufacturing processes. Although, Wikipedia lists 7 main types of manufacturing processes which we are going to discuss below. 7 Main types of Manufacturing Processes and their subtypes Figure 1.1: Flowchart illustrating different types of manufacturing processes A good video summarizing 6 of the 7 manufacturing processes is linked below. Coating / Plating is missing. 1.1 Casting Casting is a process of pouring liquid metal into a mold containing the hollow shape of the desired outcome. It uses sprue, gates, and runners to pour the metal. The main types of manufacturing processes under casting are:- 1.1.1 Centrifugal Casting Centrifugal casting is a process of pouring molten metal into a spinning die. Spinning die creates high g-forces to the molten metal which gives it the cylindrical shape. Moreover, spinning let the impurities (less dense material) to float at the inner dia from where it is removed later. Spinning can either be on a vertical or horizontal axis depending on the configuration of the desired part such as vertical rotation is used to cast ring and cylinder and horizontal rotation is used to cast tubular shapes. Figure 1.2: Centrifugal Casting Example: Some examples of centrifugal casting include jet engine compressor cases, petrochemical furnace tubes, military products, and other high-reliability applications. 1.1.2 Die Casting Die casting is a manufacturing process used for producing metal parts where high precision is required. This process is accomplished by forcing molten metal under high pressure into reusable metal dies. High volume production is done using this process. Figure 1.3: Die Casting Process Steel molds capable of producing several castings at once are produced. Molds are mounted securely in a die casting machine and are arranged so that one is stationary while the other is moveable. The die cavity is injected with molten metal and allowed to solidify and the part is ejected. Example: Die casting process is used for producing precise non-ferrous metal parts. Some examples of die casting include engines, clutch housings, and covers of a four-wheeled vehicle. 1.1.3 Sand Casting Sand casting is a metal casting process that uses sand as the mold material. This process has a low production rate as the sand mold must be destroyed in order to remove the part. Although, it is a cheap process when low volume production is required. Figure 1.4: Sand Casting Sand Casting Process: * Materials used include the furnace, metal, pattern, and sand mold. * The molten metal is poured using a ladle into the cavity of the sand mold, which is created using the pattern. * The casting is allowed to solidify and then removed by breaking the sand mold. Example: More than 70% of all metal castings are produced via sand casting process. Some examples of sand casting process include engine blocks, machine tool bases, cylinder heads, pump housings, valves, gears, pulleys, crankshafts, connecting rods, and propellers. 1.1.4 Permanent Mold Casting Permanent mold casting is a manufacturing process that offers reusability of metal molds which makes it eligible for high volume production. This process uses gravity or vacuum or gas to fill the mold. Figure 1.5: Permanent Mold Casting Process The mold is preheated and a ceramic coating is applied to the mold cavity surfaces to facilitate part removal. The molten metal is poured from a ladle and gravity or vacuum is used to raise the molten metal into the mold assembly. The casting is allowed to solidify and then removed by opening the mold assembly. Example: Some examples of permanent mold casting include gears, pipe fittings, fuel injection housings, splines, wheels, gear housings, engine pistons. Note the difference: Sand casting uses an expendable mold which is destroyed after each cycle whereas permanent mold casting and die casting uses a metal mold that is reused for several thousand times. Permanent mold casting process is considerably slower, and not as precise as die casting. Also, an external force is used to inject molten metal in die casting as compared to gravity or vacuum in permanent mold casting. 1.1.5 Investment Casting Investment casting is metal casting process of pouring molten metal into an expendable ceramic mold. This process is also known as “lost-wax casting” as the wax pattern is melted out of the mold when molten metal is poured. Complex parts are made using this process. Figure 1.6: Investment Casting Process The wax pattern is prepared and surrounded/invested by the ceramic slurry that hardens it and converts it into a mold. The mold is preheated to evaporate the wax and the molten metal is poured from a ladle into the mold. The casting is allowed to solidify and then the mold is broken and the casting removed. Example: Some examples of investment casting include turbine blades, airplane parts, firearm components and military equipment. 1.1.6 Shell Molding Shell molding is a metal casting process that uses a sand covered with resin to form the mold. This process is similar to sand casting process but has better dimensional accuracy, higher productivity rate, and lower labor requirements. Also, the Shell Molds are reusable and expandable. Figure 1.7: Shell Molding Process A two-piece metal pattern is created in the shape of the desired part using iron or steel. These patterns are clamped to a dump box containing the mixture of sand and a resin binder. This is known as shell preparation method. These shells are joined together and clamped to form the complete shell mold and the molten metal is poured from a ladle into the mold cavity. After the casting is solidified, the mold is broken and the casting removed. Example: Shell molding is used for producing high precision parts. Some examples of shell molding include gear housings, cylinder heads, connecting rods, and lever arms. 1.2 Molding Molding is a manufacturing process that uses a rigid frame to shape hot liquid or a ductile raw material. It is mostly used to manufacture plastic products. The different types of manufacturing processes under molding are: 1.2.1 Injection Molding Injection molding is a molding process used for producing parts by injecting molten material into a mold. It is the most commonly used molding process for manufacturing plastic parts. This process requires the use of an injection molding machine, raw plastic pellets, and a mold to get the desired output. The plastic is melted in the injection molding machine with the help of heaters and then a rotating/reciprocating screw injects it into the mold, where it cools and solidifies into the final part. Figure 1.8: Injection Molding Example: Some examples of injection molding include automotive parts and components, game toys, chairs, tables, storage containers, housing for household appliances, consumer electronics, buckets. 1.2.2 Blow Molding Blow molding is a molding process used to manufacture hollow plastic parts. This process starts with melting down the plastic and forming it into a parison. The parison is then clamped into a mold and air is blown into it. This air pushes the plastic out to match the mold. The plastic is allowed to cool and later the mold opened and the part is ejected. Although the blow molding process is costlier than injection molding, it is still used for manufacturing many plastic products. Blow molding is divided into three types of manufacturing processes namely extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, and injection stretch blow molding. Figure 1.9: Blow Molding Example: Some examples of blow molding include automotive ducts, stadium seating chairs, containers, trays, reservoirs, tanks, coolers, fan housings, panels, doors, toys, sporting goods, watering cans and household products, carrying cases. 1.2.3 Extrusion Molding Extrusion Molding is a process used to manufacture long tube-shaped products of a fixed cross-section. This process uses an extrusion machine to force the heated plastic through a die with an opening. The machine uses a reciprocating/rotating screw to feed the plastic into the die. The die then forces the material into the desired shape or the shape of the die. Heaters are used to melting the plastic in the extrusion machine. The material is allowed to cooled and then cut down into the required shape. Figure 1.10: Extrusion Molding Example: Some examples of extrusion molding include pipe, tube, plastic films and sheeting, thermoplastic coatings, and wire insulation. 1.2.4 Rotational Molding Rotational Molding is a molding process used for manufacturing hollow parts. This process is accomplished by placing resin into a hollow mold and then rotating that tool bi-axially in an oven. There is no pressure involved in this technique, unlike other plastic manufacturing processes. Thus, making the mold cost cheap and the process economical. Figure 1.11: Rotational Molding Process The mold is filled with a polymer resin and heated in an oven until the resin melts inside of the mold cavity. It is then slowly rotated to disperse and stick the soft material inside the mold cavity. A cool tool is used to solidify the part and later the part is removed from the mold. Example: Some examples of rotational molding include water tanks, medical products, consumer’s products, toys, leisure craft, sporting equipment. 1.2.5 Thermoforming Thermoforming is a molding process where a plastic sheet is heated to an elastic forming temperature and formed into the desired shape. This method is often used for sample and prototype parts. It is divided into three types of manufacturing processes namely vacuum forming, pressure forming and mechanical forming. Figure 1.12: Thermoforming Process The thermoplastic sheet is heated using either convection or radiation until it gets soften. This soft sheet is then pressed against the mold using the vacuum or air pressure or mechanical force. The excess material is then trimmed away and the formed part is released. Example: Some examples of thermoforming include switchgear, motor components, thrust washers, ash cups, valve covers, disc brake pistons, knobs, and handles. 1.2.6 Powder Metallurgy Powder metallurgy is a molding process used for manufacturing precision metal components from metal powders. The rate of production of parts is quite high in powder metallurgy which makes it economical than the other casting processes. Figure 1.13: Powder Metallurgy Process A homogeneous mixture of metal powders or alloy powders is prepared. The metal powder is then pressed into the desired shape at room temperature. At last, the product is heated that causes the powder particles to fuse together without melting. Example: Some examples of powder metallurgy include self -lubricating bearings, porous metal filters, gears, cams, brackets, sprockets. 1.3 Forming Forming is a manufacturing process that uses suitable stresses such as compression, tension or shear to deform the material and get the desired shape. This process involves deformation and displacement of material leading to no material removal or loss of material. The different types of manufacturing processes under forming are: 1.3.1 Forging Forging is a manufacturing process that uses compressive forces to shape the material. This process is accomplished with the help of a hammer, press or a special forging machine. The forged parts have good strength and toughness without the defects of porosity, inclusion or voids, also they can be used reliably for highly stressed and critical applications. Forging may be carried out on materials in either hot or cold state and therefore, it is divided into types of manufacturing processes i.e. cold forging and hot forging. Figure 1.14: Forging Example: Some examples of forging include hammers, sleds, wrenches, garden tools, sockets, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, jewelry, rivets, bolts. 1.3.2 Bending Bending is a manufacturing process used to deform metal into the desired shape by using a die and punch. This process is most commonly used for sheet metal products to get the required U-shape, V-shape or the channel shape. Commonly used bending machines are pan brakes, brake presses, and other specialized machine presses. Figure 1.15: Bending Process The material is placed on the die and positioned in place with the help of stops. The upper part of the press with appropriately shaped punch attached to it descends and forms the V-shaped bend. The U-punch forms the U-shape with a single punch. Example: Some examples of bending operations include electric enclosures, electrical boxes, brackets, rectangular ductwork. 1.3.3 Stamping Stamping or pressing is a manufacturing process in which thin walled metal parts are shaped desirably with the help of punches and dies. This process is accomplished by placing flat sheet metal into a stamping press where a tool and die surface forms the metal into the desired shape. Stamping uses hydraulic or mechanical press to perform the operations which can be done at a single die station or multiple die stations. Also, this process is usually carried out on sheet metal, but can also be used on other materials, such as polystyrene. Figure 1.16: Stamping Example: Some examples of stamping include trunks, doors, panels, enclosures, fenders, roof, and hood outer parts. 1.3.4 Shearing Shearing is a manufacturing process used to remove a blank of required shape and dimension from a large sheet of metal, paper or plastics. This process includes cutting of sheet without the formation of chips or the use of burning or melting. Shearing is divided into following types of manufacturing processes: Blanking Piercing Roll slitting Trimming Coining Process The punch applies pressure to the sheet forming cracks on both the top and bottom edges of the sheet. The punch goes down further to grow these cracks and eventually separate the slug from the material. Example Some examples of shearing include industrial machinery, automobile parts, electronic equipment, knives, scissors. 1.4 Machining Machining is a manufacturing process used to cut a piece of raw material into the desired shape and size with the help of controlled material-removal process. These processes are based on a common theme known as subtractive manufacturing. The machining process is used for all the types of product especially metal products. The different types of manufacturing processes under machining are: Figure 1.17: Machining Milling is a process of removal of material from a workpiece using rotary cutters and getting the desired shape. Turning is a process of removal of unwanted material from circular parts using a cutting tool. This process requires a lathe, workpiece, fixture, and a cutting tool. Shaping process uses a cutting tool that reciprocates against a stationary workpiece producing a plane or a desired surface. Drilling process uses a drill bit to make a hole of circular cross-section into the solid material. Honing process produces a precision surface on a metal workpiece by scrubbing an abrasive stone against it. Finishing process is used to improve appearance, adhesion, wettability, wear resistance, hardness or to remove burrs and other surface flaws with the help of sanders. 1.5 Joining Joining or assembling process are part of every production processes where two or more parts are combined together to get the required product. The main types of manufacturing processes under joining are: Figure 1.18: Joining Welding process is used to heat and melt two or more parts and force them together making a single functional part. Arc welding, resistance welding, oxyfuel gas welding are few types of welding operations. Soldering process is also used to join two or more metal items by melting and putting a filler metal (solder) into the joint. It differs from welding as it does not involve melting of the workpieces. Brazing process is used to join two or more metal items together by melting and flowing a filler metal into the joint. Brazing uses higher temperatures for a similar process as compared to soldering. Also, it requires much more closely fitted parts than in soldering. Adhesive bonding is used to hold multiple closely spaced parts together using a filler material called an adhesive. It is mainly used for a non-metallic substance such as a polymer. Mechanical Assembly – It is a fastening process which uses nut, bolts, and rivets to join the parts together. It is also a reversible joining process. 1.6 Coating or Plating This process is defined as a method of covering the part surface with powder or zinc or other chemicals to protect it from corrosion, wear and other defects. It is also done to improve the electrical conductivity or magnetic response of the material. The main types of manufacturing processes under the coating process are powder coating, electroplating, sputter deposition. Figure 1.19: Coating or Plating 1.7 Additive Manufacturing Additive manufacturing is the process reversible to subtractive manufacturing i.e. machining. It is a manufacturing process that builds 3D objects by adding layer-upon-layer of material, whether the material is plastic, metal or concrete. Additive manufacturing comprises many technologies such as 3D printing, rapid prototyping, direct digital manufacturing, layered manufacturing and additive fabrication. This technology is growing at a very fast speed due to its high-efficiency and accuracy. Figure 1.20: Additive Manufacturing Example: Some examples of 3D printing include jewelry, toys, decorative items, phone cases.

Process engineering is a specialized branch of engineering that focuses on the optimization of complex production processes, as well as the design, analysis, and implementation of manufacturing systems. What is the role of automation in various manufacturing processes? With the push for Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing and the importance of reaching higher productivity and efficiency levels, automation in manufacturing is paramount. What are advantages of automation in manufacturing? Lowered Operating Costs Improved Worker Safety Reduced Factory Lead Times Increased Production Output Smaller Environmental Footprint Increased Productivity and Efficiency Increased System Versatility What are disadvantages of automation in manufacturing? Higher Start-up cost and the cost of operation. Higher Cost of Maintenance. Obsolescence/Depreciation Cost. Unemployment. Not economically justifiable for small scale production. 2.1 Types of automation in various manufacturing processes Fixed automation – large volume, single part productions Fixed automation is a system in which the sequence of processing (or assembly) operations is fixed by the equipment configuration. Each of the operations is the sequence is usually simple, involving perhaps a plain linear or rotational motion or an uncomplicated combination of the two; for example, the feeding of a rotating spindle Programmable automation – associated with batch production In programmable automation, the production equipment is designed with the capability to change the sequence of operations to accommodate different product configuration. The operation sequence is controlled by a program, which is a set of instructions coded so that they can be read and interpreted by the system. New programs can be prepared and entered into the equipment to produce new products Flexible automation – Real time, on-demand production Flexible automation is an extension of programmable automation. A flexible automated system is capable of producing a variety of parts (or products) with virtually no time lost for changeovers from one part style to the next. There is no lost production time while reprogramming the system and altering the physical setup (tooling, fixtures, machine settings). Consequently, the system can produce various combinations and schedules of parts or products instead of requiring that they be made in batches.

Figure 3.1: Production Line 3.2.1 Methods of Work Transport Manual Methods of Work Transport Manual methods involve passing the work units between stations by hand. Types: Work units moved in batches Work units moved one at a time Problems: Starving of stations Blocking of stations No pacing Mechanized Methods of Work Transport Mechanized methods use powered conveyor or other mechanized apparatus to move work units. Three major types of work transfer systems are used on production lines: continuous transfer synchronous transfer asynchronous transfer Categories: Work units attached to conveyor Work units are removable from conveyor Problems Starving of stations Incomplete units Continuous Transport Figure 3.2: Continuous Transport Conveyor moves at constant velocity vc Figure 3.3: Synchronous Transport All work units are moved simultaneously to their respective next workstations with quick, discontinuous motion. Figure 3.4: Asynchronous Transport Work units move independently, not simultaneously. A work unit departs a given station when the worker releases it. Small queues of parts can form at each station. 3.2.2 What is Work Cycle? Manually Operated Machine Figure 3.5: Manually Operated Machine Manually operated machines are controlled or supervised by a human worker. The machine provides the power for the operation and the worker provides the control. The entire work cycle is operator controlled. Semi-Automated Machine Figure 3.6: Semi-Automated Machine A semi-automated machine performs a portion of the work cycle under some form of program control, and a worker tends to the machine for the remainder of the cycle. Typical worker tasks include loading and unloading parts. Fully-Automated Machine Figure 3.7: Fully-Automated Machine Machine operates for extended periods (longer than one work cycle) without worker attention. 3.2.3 Work Transport Between Stations Two general categories of work transport in multi-station manufacturing systems: Fixed routing Work units always flow through the same sequence of workstations Most production lines exemplify this category Figure 3.8: Fixed Routing Variable routing Work units are moved through a variety of different station sequences Most job shops exemblify this category Figure 3.9: Variable Routing 3.2.4 ⏰ Explaining Manufacturing Process Times Figure 3.10: Timing Definition The flowchart illustrates three crucial time metrics: Lead Time, Throughput Time, and Cycle Time. These metrics are sequential, with the largest time window encompassing the smaller ones. 3.2.4.1 Lead Time Definition: Lead Time is the total time elapsed from the moment a customer places an order until they receive the finished product. It represents the customer’s total wait time. What it includes: It covers every step, from order receipt through manufacturing, testing, and shipping (Delivery at Customer). Example: A customer orders a custom-made widget on Monday. If order processing, manufacturing, and shipping take a total of 6 days, the Total Lead Time = 6 days. 3.2.4.2 Throughput Time Definition: Throughput Time (or Manufacturing Lead Time) is the time required to convert raw materials into a finished product that is ready for dispatch. It starts when the Raw Material (RM) is Received and ends when the product is Dispatched from the factory. What it includes: All activities within the factory walls, including processing (Turning, Drilling, Tapping), movement, inspection, and any queuing/waiting time before dispatch. Example: If the total time spent from raw material receipt to final dispatch from the factory is 3 days, the Total Throughput Time = 3 days. 3.2.4.3 Cycle Time Cycle Time is typically broken into two related concepts: Overall Cycle Time and Individual Cycle Time. 3.2.4.3.1 Overall Cycle Time (As labeled in the diagram) Definition: The Overall Cycle Time refers to the total time spent actively converting the raw material into a final, ready-to-ship product, beginning with the first value-added operation (like Turning) and ending with the last (like Dispatch). What it includes: The sum of all individual process times plus any immediate in-process wait times (e.g., Cycle Time 1 + Cycle Time 2 + …). 3.2.4.3.2 Individual Cycle Time (Cycle Time 1, Cycle Time 2, etc.) Definition: This refers to the time it takes to complete a single specific task or process step (e.g., Turning, Drilling, Tapping) on a single product unit. Example: If the individual processing steps take 30 minutes for Turning, 15 minutes for Drilling, and 10 minutes for Tapping, these are the individual cycle times for those specific tasks. 3.2.5  Cycle Time vs. Efficiency in Manufacturing (Adel Nabil 2025) Ever wondered how to measure and improve your manufacturing process? Let’s dive into two key metrics that drive efficiency: Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT) and Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE)! 3.2.5.1  Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT) This metric tells us how long it takes to produce each unit. 3.2.5.1.1 Formula: \\[ MCT = \\frac{\\text{Production Time}}{\\text{Units Produced}} \\] Understanding MCT allows us to identify delays and improve production speed. Reducing cycle time leads to quicker delivery and increased customer satisfaction! 3.2.5.1.2 Calculation Example: Let’s assume a production run takes 480 minutes (8 hours) and produces 60 units. ## Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT): 8 minutes per unit 3.2.5.2  Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE) This metric reveals the efficiency of the production process by focusing on the actual “Process Time” (value-added time) within the entire production period. 3.2.5.2.1 Formula: \\[ \\text{MCE} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Process Time}}{\\text{Production Time}}\\right) \\times 100\\% \\] Process Time is the time spent on activities that directly add value to the product. Production Time includes process time plus non-value-added time (e.g., inspection, waiting, moving). Higher MCE means less waste and more value-added time in production. Aiming for a higher MCE drives leaner operations and cost savings. 3.2.5.2.2 Calculation Example: ## Total Production Time (minutes): 515.49 ## Value-Added Process Time (minutes): 186.41 ## --- ## Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE): 36.16 % Figure 3.11: MCT and MCE 3.2.6 Product Variations In modern manufacturing, systems must handle different levels of product variety. We distinguish between Hard Product Variety (significant differences between products) and Soft Product Variety (small differences, such as color or minor features). As shown in Figure 3.12, the complexity of the system increases as we move toward mass customization. 3.3 Manual Assembly Lines Manual assembly lines consist of multiple workstations where human workers perform repetitive tasks. The efficiency of these lines is governed by the relationship between production rate and cycle time. 3.3.1 Production Rate and Cycle Time The production rate (\\(R_p\\)) is the number of units produced per hour. The cycle time (\\(T_c\\)) is the time interval between units coming off the end of the line. The mathematical relationship is defined as: \\[T_c = \\frac{60}{R_p}\\] where \\(T_c\\) is in minutes and \\(R_p\\) is in units/hour. 3.3.2 Line Balancing and Repositioning Losses One of the greatest challenges in manual lines is Line Balancing. This involves assigning tasks to workstations so that the total work content time (\\(T_{wc}\\)) is distributed evenly. The efficiency of the balance (\\(E_b\\)) is calculated as: \\[E_b = \\frac{T_{wc}}{n T_c}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of workstations. library(ggplot2) # Simulating data for manufacturing system types df &lt;- data.frame( Variety = c(&quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;High&quot;), Volume = c(1000, 500, 50), Type = c(&quot;Transfer Line&quot;, &quot;FMS&quot;, &quot;Job Shop&quot;) ) ggplot(df, aes(x = Variety, y = Volume, fill = Type)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, width = 0.6) + theme_minimal() + labs(title = &quot;Volume vs. Variety Trade-off&quot;, x = &quot;Product Variety&quot;, y = &quot;Annual Production Volume&quot;) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Set2&quot;) Figure 3.12: Relationship between Production Volume and Product Variety. 3.4 Automated Production Lines Automated lines reduce human intervention by using mechanized transfer systems and automated workstations. These systems are typically used for high-volume production where the work content is well-defined. 3.4.1 Types of Automated Lines There are two primary configurations for these systems: In-line configuration: A straight line of workstations where the part moves sequentially from one station to the next. Rotary configuration: Workstations are arranged around a circular table, often called an indexing table. 3.4.2 Analysis of Automated Production Lines The performance of an automated line is often degraded by station failures. If \\(p\\) is the probability of a station failure and \\(T\\) is the average downtime, the actual production rate (\\(R_p\\)) is significantly lower than the ideal rate (\\(R_c\\)) due to downtime. The actual cycle time (\\(T_p\\)) is calculated as: \\[T_p = T_c + pT\\] Where: * \\(T_p\\) = Average production time per unit. * \\(T_c\\) = Ideal cycle time. * \\(p\\) = Probability of station failure. * \\(T\\) = Average downtime to repair and restart. 3.4.3 Analysis of Automated Production Lines The performance of an automated line is rarely ideal; it is degraded by station failures (e.g., tool breakage, jams). If we define: * \\(T_c\\): Ideal cycle time (minutes/cycle). * \\(p\\): Probability of a station failure per cycle. * \\(T\\): Average downtime per failure (minutes) to repair and restart. The Actual Cycle Time (\\(T_p\\)) increases significantly: \\[T_p = T_c + p \\times T\\] Consequently, the Actual Production Rate (\\(R_p\\)) (units per hour) drops below the ideal rate (\\(R_c = 60/T_c\\)): \\[R_p = \\frac{60}{T_p} = \\frac{60}{T_c + pT}\\] To visualize the severe impact of even small failure probabilities on high-speed lines, we can simulate different downtime scenarios. Figure 3.13 illustrates how quickly production capacity is lost as reliability decreases. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(scales) #--- Simulation Parameters --- Ideal_Tc &lt;- 1.0 # Ideal cycle time is 1 minute per part Ideal_Rp &lt;- 60 / Ideal_Tc # Ideal rate is 60 units/hour # 1.

As demonstrated in Figure (ref?)(fig:downtime-sim), even a seemingly low failure probability of 5% (\\(p=0.05\\)) can cripple production if the average repair time is long. In the “Major Repair” scenario at 5% failure, production drops from an ideal 60 units/hr to roughly 24 units/hr—a 60% loss in capacity. This highlights why preventive maintenance and rapid repair protocols are critical in automated systems. 3.5 Cellular Manufacturing Cellular manufacturing applies Group Technology (GT) to organize production into cells that specialize in “families” of parts. 3.5.1 Part Families A part family is a collection of parts that share similar geometric shapes or manufacturing process steps. By grouping these together, we significantly reduce setup times and simplify tooling requirements. 3.5.2 Machine Cells Machine cells are designed to process one or more part families. The arrangement usually follows a U-shape, which allows a single operator to move between multiple machines efficiently, facilitating better communication and line balancing. 3.6 Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) and Cells An FMS is a highly automated GT cell, consisting of a group of processing stations (usually CNC machines) interconnected by an automated handling system. 3.6.1 Integrating the FMS Components Integration is achieved through a central computer system that coordinates: Workstation operations: Sending CNC programs to individual machines. Material handling system: Controlling AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) or conveyors. Loading and unloading: Managing the entry and exit of parts from the system. 3.6.2 Applications of Flexible Manufacturing Systems FMS is best suited for mid-volume, mid-variety production where the cost of a fully dedicated transfer line is too high, but the manual job shop is too slow and inefficient. 3.6.3 Mass Customization Mass customization is the logic of providing products tailored to individual customer needs at a cost near that of mass-produced items (Groover 2016). As seen in Figure 3.12, FMS is the primary technological enabler of this strategy. 3.7 Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) CIM represents the total integration of all aspects of the manufacturing enterprise through computers. It creates a seamless flow of information from the design phase to the shipping dock. CIM includes not just the shop floor hardware (FMS, Robots), but also: CAD/CAM: Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing. ERP: Enterprise Resource Planning for resource management. CAPP: Computer-Aided Process Planning. References Groover, Mikell P. 2016. Automation, Production Systems, and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing. Pearson.

Plant layout directly impacts: Productivity: Efficient layouts minimize wasted movement and time Cost: Poor layouts increase material handling costs by 20-50% Safety: Well-designed layouts reduce accidents and injuries Flexibility: The right layout allows adaptation to changing demands Employee Morale: Good layouts improve working conditions 4.2 Types of Facility Layouts There are four basic layout types, each suited to different production requirements: Table 4.1: Overview of Facility Layout Types Layout Type Also Known As Best For Example Industries Process Layout Functional Layout, Job Shop High variety, low volume Hospitals, Machine Shops, Universities Product Layout Flow Line, Assembly Line Low variety, high volume Automotive Assembly, Food Processing Hybrid/Cellular Layout Group Technology, Cell Layout Medium variety, medium volume Electronics Manufacturing, Furniture Fixed-Position Layout Project Layout Very large or immobile products Shipbuilding, Aircraft, Construction 4.2.1 Visualizing the Layout Spectrum Figure 4.1: Product Variety vs. Production Volume for Different Layouts 4.3 Process Layout (Functional Layout) In a process layout, similar resources (machines, equipment, workers with similar skills) are grouped together. Work flows between departments based on the specific requirements of each job. Figure 4.2: Example Process Layout - Machine Shop 4.3.1 Characteristics of Process Layouts Table 4.2: Process Layout Characteristics Characteristic Description Equipment General-purpose machines Labor Skilled workers required Flexibility High - can handle variety Processing Speed Slower due to varied routing Material Handling Higher costs (complex paths) Scheduling Complex - different routes Space Requirements Higher - WIP inventory storage Discussion Question: Can you identify a process layout in your daily life? Think about: - A hospital emergency room (patients routed based on their needs) - A university campus (students move between buildings for different classes) - A grocery store (customers choose their own path) - A machine shop (parts routed based on required operations) What makes these process layouts? Similar functions are grouped together, and “products” (patients, students, customers) follow different paths based on their individual needs. 4.3.2 Real-World Examples 4.4 Product Layout (Assembly Line) In a product layout, equipment and workstations are arranged in a line according to the sequence of operations needed to produce the product. Every unit follows the same path. Figure 4.3: Product Layout - Assembly Line 4.4.1 Characteristics of Product Layouts Table 4.3: Product Layout: Advantages vs. Disadvantages Advantage Disadvantage High production rate High initial investment Low unit cost Low flexibility Low material handling Line stops affect all Simple scheduling Monotonous work Less WIP inventory Requires balanced workloads Quick Quiz: Product Layout Question: A car wash where vehicles move through a series of cleaning stations is an example of which layout type? Answer: Product Layout - all cars follow the same path through the same sequence of operations. 4.5 Hybrid Layout (Cellular Manufacturing) Hybrid layouts combine the flexibility of process layouts with the efficiency of product layouts. The most common type is the cellular layout using Group Technology. 4.5.1 Group Technology Concept Group Technology (GT) identifies parts with similar characteristics and groups them into part families. Machines are then arranged into cells to process these families. Figure 4.4: Cellular Layout with Manufacturing Cells Discussion Question: Benefits of Cellular Manufacturing What are the main benefits of cellular manufacturing over traditional process layouts? Reduced material handling - Parts stay within the cell Shorter lead times - No waiting between departments Less WIP inventory - Smaller batches, faster flow Improved quality - Workers responsible for complete part Team accountability - Cell teams own their output 4.6 Fixed-Position Layout In a fixed-position layout, the product remains stationary while workers, equipment, and materials are brought to it. This is used when the product is too large or heavy to move. 4.6.1 Examples of Fixed-Position Layouts Shipbuilding - Ships built in dry docks Aircraft manufacturing - Large aircraft assembled in hangars Construction - Buildings, bridges, dams Surgery - Patient remains stationary Challenge Question: Managing a Fixed-Position Layout What are the unique challenges of managing a fixed-position layout? Think about: - Scheduling deliveries of materials and equipment - Coordinating multiple contractors/teams - Limited space around the product - Weather and environmental factors (outdoor projects) - Ensuring safety with many workers in one area 4.7 Designing Process Layouts Designing an effective process layout involves three main steps: 4.7.1 Step 1: Gather Information You need to determine: - Space requirements for each department - Available space in the facility - Closeness relationships between departments 4.7.1.1 From-To Matrix (Load Matrix) A From-To matrix shows the number of trips or loads between departments: Table 4.4: From-To Matrix: Loads per Day Between Departments Receiving Machining Assembly Painting Shipping Receiving 100 50 0 0 Machining 0 200 50 0 Assembly 0 0 100 60 Painting 0 0 0 150 Shipping 0 0 0 0 4.7.2 Step 2: Develop Block Plans Use the Load-Distance Model to evaluate layout alternatives: \\[\\text{Total Cost} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} L_{ij} \\times D_{ij} \\times C\\] Where: - \\(L_{ij}\\) = Number of loads between departments \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) - \\(D_{ij}\\) = Distance between departments \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) - \\(C\\) = Cost per unit distance 4.7.3 Interactive Example: Comparing Two Layouts Figure 4.5: Comparing Two Process Layout Alternatives # Calculate Load-Distance scores for both layouts # From-To data: Receiving-&gt;Machining=100, Machining-&gt;Assembly=200, # Assembly-&gt;Painting=100, Painting-&gt;Shipping=150 # Layout A distances (linear): all adjacent = 1 unit layout_A_score &lt;- 100*1 + 200*1 + 100*1 + 150*1 cat(&quot;Layout A Total Load-Distance:&quot;, layout_A_score, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Layout A Total Load-Distance: 550 # Layout B distances (compact): most departments closer together # Receiving to Machining = 1.12 (diagonal) # Machining to Assembly = 1 # Assembly to Painting = 1.12 (diagonal) # Painting to Shipping = 1 layout_B_score &lt;- 100*1.12 + 200*1 + 100*1.12 + 150*1 cat(&quot;Layout B Total Load-Distance:&quot;, round(layout_B_score, 1), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Layout B Total Load-Distance: 574 cat(&quot;\\nLayout A is better by:&quot;, round(layout_B_score - layout_A_score, 1), &quot;units&quot;) ## ## Layout A is better by: 24 units Why does the linear layout win in this case? In this example, the linear layout (A) wins because the process flow is essentially sequential (Receiving → Machining → Assembly → Painting → Shipping). When flow is sequential, a product layout (linear arrangement) is more efficient. Process layouts are better when there’s varied routing between departments. 4.7.4 Step 3: Develop Detailed Layout Once the block plan is selected: - Determine exact sizes and shapes of departments - Plan aisle locations and widths - Consider utilities, safety exits, and accessibility - Use CAD software or 3D modeling for visualization 4.8 Designing Product Layouts (Line Balancing) The key challenge in product layout design is line balancing - assigning tasks to workstations to minimize idle time while meeting production requirements. 4.8.1 Line Balancing Steps Identify tasks and precedence relationships Calculate required cycle time Calculate theoretical minimum number of stations Assign tasks to stations Calculate efficiency 4.8.2 Key Formulas Cycle Time: \\[C = \\frac{\\text{Available Production Time}}{\\text{Desired Output}}\\] Theoretical Minimum Stations: \\[TM = \\frac{\\sum t_i}{C}\\] Line Efficiency: \\[\\text{Efficiency} = \\frac{\\sum t_i}{n \\times C} \\times 100\\%\\] Where: - \\(C\\) = Cycle time - \\(\\sum t_i\\) = Total task time - \\(n\\) = Number of workstations 4.8.3 Interactive Example: Pizza Assembly Line Table 4.5: Pizza Assembly Tasks Task Description Time (sec) Predecessors A Roll dough 40 B Spread sauce 25 A C Add cheese 20 B D Add toppings 35 B E Season 15 C, D F Box pizza 30 E Figure 4.6: Precedence Diagram for Pizza Assembly 4.8.4 Line Balancing Calculation # Given data total_task_time &lt;- 40 + 25 + 20 + 35 + 15 + 30 # seconds desired_output &lt;- 60 # pizzas per hour available_time &lt;- 3600 # seconds per hour # Step 1: Calculate Cycle Time cycle_time &lt;- available_time / desired_output cat(&quot;Cycle Time:&quot;, cycle_time, &quot;seconds per pizza\\n&quot;) ## Cycle Time: 60 seconds per pizza # Step 2: Calculate Theoretical Minimum Stations TM &lt;- total_task_time / cycle_time cat(&quot;Theoretical Minimum Stations:&quot;, TM, &quot;=&quot;, ceiling(TM), &quot;stations\\n&quot;) ## Theoretical Minimum Stations: 2.75 = 3 stations # Step 3: Assign tasks to stations (one possible solution) cat(&quot;\\n--- Workstation Assignments ---\\n&quot;) ## ## --- Workstation Assignments --- cat(&quot;Station 1: A (40s) + B (25s) = 65s &gt; 60s ...

EXCEEDS! cat(&quot;Revised:\\n&quot;) ## Revised: cat(&quot;Station 3: C (20s) + E (15s) = 35s [Idle: 25s]\\n&quot;) ## Station 3: C (20s) + E (15s) = 35s [Idle: 25s] cat(&quot;Station 4: F (30s) = 30s [Idle: 30s]\\n&quot;) ## Station 4: F (30s) = 30s [Idle: 30s] # With 4 stations n_stations &lt;- 4 efficiency &lt;- (total_task_time / (n_stations * cycle_time)) * 100 cat(&quot;\\n--- Results ---\\n&quot;) ## ## --- Results --- cat(&quot;Number of Stations:&quot;, n_stations, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Number of Stations: 4 cat(&quot;Line Efficiency:&quot;, round(efficiency, 1), &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Line Efficiency: 68.8 % cat(&quot;Balance Delay (Idle Time):&quot;, round(100 - efficiency, 1), &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Balance Delay (Idle Time): 31.2 % Try It Yourself: Can you find a better balance? Challenge: Can you assign tasks to only 3 stations while respecting the precedence constraints? Hint: Consider these assignments: - Station 1: A (40s) + ? - Station 2: B (25s) + ? + ? - Station 3: ? + ? Remember: Total time per station cannot exceed 60 seconds! Solution: It’s actually possible with careful planning: - Station 1: A (40s) = 40s - Station 2: B (25s) + C (20s) + E (15s) = 60s (but E needs C AND D complete!) So 3 stations is NOT feasible due to precedence constraints. The minimum is 4 stations for this problem. 4.9 Warehouse Layout Design Warehouse layouts are a special case of process layouts focused on minimizing material handling. 4.9.1 Key Principles Place high-volume items near the dock Group items that are often picked together Use ABC analysis for storage assignment: A items (20% of SKUs, 80% of picks): Prime locations B items (30% of SKUs, 15% of picks): Secondary locations C items (50% of SKUs, 5% of picks): Remote locations Figure 4.7: Warehouse Layout: ABC Storage Strategy 4.10 Office Layout Design Office layouts balance communication needs with privacy requirements. 4.10.1 Two Main Approaches Table 4.6: Office Layout Comparison Aspect Open Plan Traditional/Closed Space Shared workspaces Private offices Walls Partitions/dividers Permanent walls Flexibility High - easy to reconfigure Low - expensive to change Communication Excellent Limited Privacy Low High Cost Lower Higher 4.10.2 Office Ergonomics Checklist Click to expand: Office Ergonomics Best Practices Posture: - Support the small of the back - Keep shoulders relaxed - Maintain neutral wrist position - Feet flat on floor or footrest Lighting: - Position monitor to reduce glare - Adjust brightness for screen vs. paper work - Use task lighting when needed Workstation: - Monitor at arm’s length - Top of screen at or below eye level - Keyboard and mouse at elbow height Work Habits: - Take breaks every 30-60 minutes - Vary tasks to prevent repetitive strain - Use keyboard shortcuts to reduce mouse use 4.10.3 The Future of Office Design 4.11 Summary: Choosing the Right Layout Figure 4.8: Layout Selection Decision Guide 4.11.1 Key Takeaways Process layouts offer flexibility for varied products but have higher material handling costs Product layouts are efficient for high-volume, standardized products Cellular layouts provide a middle ground with benefits of both Fixed-position layouts are necessary when products cannot be moved Line balancing is critical for efficient product layouts Warehouse layouts should minimize travel distance for high-frequency items 4.12 Practice Problems Problem 1: Layout Selection Scenario: A company manufactures custom kitchen cabinets. Each order is unique, with different dimensions, materials, and finishes. Production volume is about 50 units per month. Question: Which layout type would you recommend and why? Answer: A process layout would be most appropriate because: - High product variety (custom orders) - Low production volume - Different operations needed for each order - Flexibility is more important than efficiency Problem 2: Line Balancing Given: - Total task time: 240 seconds - Desired output: 30 units per hour - Available time: 3600 seconds per hour Calculate: 1. Cycle time 2. Theoretical minimum number of stations 3. If you use 3 stations, what is the efficiency? Solution: 1. Cycle time = 3600 / 30 = 120 seconds 2. TM = 240 / 120 = 2 stations 3. Efficiency = (240 / (3 × 120)) × 100 = 66.7% Problem 3: Warehouse Layout Scenario: A warehouse has the following items: - Item X: 500 picks/day - Item Y: 100 picks/day - Item Z: 50 picks/day Question: How should these items be positioned relative to the shipping dock? Answer: Using ABC analysis: - Item X (high frequency): Closest to dock (A zone) - Item Y (medium frequency): Middle distance (B zone) - Item Z (low frequency): Farthest from dock (C zone) 4.13 References Reid, R.

But if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence.” — Vince Lombardi 5.2 Introduction to Lean Manufacturing Lean Manufacturing is the systematic elimination of waste. The term can be traced to Jim Womack, Daniel Jones, and Daniel Roos’ book The Machine that Changed the World (1991), which examined the Toyota Production System. What does “Lean” actually mean? The term “Lean” refers to cutting “fat” from production activities — eliminating anything that doesn’t add value to the customer. Think of it like a lean athlete: no excess weight, maximum efficiency, peak performance. 5.2.1 Definition of Lean Table 5.1: Lean Manufacturing Targets (Womack, Jones, Roos 1990) Metric Lean Target Human effort in factory Half the hours Defects in finished product Half the defects Engineering effort One-third the hours Factory space for same output Half the space In-process inventories A tenth or less 5.3 Evolution of Manufacturing Systems Manufacturing has evolved through three major paradigms. Understanding this evolution helps us appreciate why Lean emerged as the dominant philosophy. Figure 5.1: Evolution of Manufacturing Systems 5.3.1 Comparison of Manufacturing Systems Table 5.2: Evolution of Manufacturing Systems Characteristic Craft Manufacturing Mass Manufacturing Lean Manufacturing Time Period Late 1800s 1920s (Ford) 1970s - Present Process Built on blocks, workers walk around Assembly line Cells or flexible lines Workforce Craftsmen with pride Low skilled, simplistic jobs Highly skilled, proud of product Components Hand-crafted, hand-fitted Interchangeable parts Interchangeable, high variety Quality Excellent Lower Excellent (mandatory) Cost Very expensive Affordable Continuously decreasing Volume Few produced Billions - identical High volume, high variety Flexibility Very high Very low High Discussion: Why did Mass Manufacturing dominate for so long? Mass manufacturing dominated because: Economies of scale - Higher volume = lower unit cost Predictable demand - Post-war boom created stable markets Limited competition - Few global competitors Consumer acceptance - “Any color as long as it’s black” (Henry Ford) What changed? - Global competition (especially from Japan) - Customers demanded variety and quality - Product lifecycles shortened - Technology enabled flexibility 5.4 The Toyota Production System (TPS) The most influential lean manufacturing model is the Toyota Production System (TPS), developed by Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo at Toyota. 5.4.1 Historical Context Figure 5.2: Toyota’s Journey to Lean Excellence In 1949, Toyota was on the brink of bankruptcy. Ford’s car production was at least 8 times more efficient than Toyota’s. Kiichiro Toyoda’s Challenge: “To achieve the same rate of production as the United States in three years.” Taiichi Ohno accepted this challenge. Inspired by American supermarkets, he developed the Just-in-Time method. 5.4.2 Two Pillars of TPS Figure 5.3: The Two Pillars of Toyota Production System 1. Just-in-Time (JIT): Produce only what is needed, when it is needed, in the amount needed. 2. Jidoka (Built-in Quality): Automation with a human touch — stop production immediately when a defect is detected. 5.5 The 3 M’s of Lean Lean manufacturing focuses on eliminating three types of inefficiency, known as the 3 M’s: Figure 5.4: The 3 M’s of Lean Manufacturing Table 5.3: The 3 M’s Explained Japanese English Description Example Muda (無駄) Waste Activities that consume resources without adding value Excess inventory, waiting, defects Mura (斑) Inconsistency/Unevenness Variation and lack of uniformity in processes Uneven production schedules, variable quality Muri (無理) Overburden/Unreasonableness Overburdening people or equipment beyond capacity Unrealistic deadlines, overworked employees 5.6 The Seven Types of Waste (MUDA) Shigeo Shingo identified seven categories of waste common to manufacturing. These are activities that add cost without adding value. “Waste is everything that is not absolutely essential.” — Hiroyuki Hirano Figure 5.5: The Seven Types of Waste (TIMWOOD) 5.6.1 Detailed Breakdown of the Seven Wastes Table 5.4: The Seven Wastes: Detailed Analysis # Waste Type Description Examples Solution 1 Overproduction Producing more than needed, earlier than needed Building to forecast, large batch sizes Pull systems, smaller batches 2 Inventory Excess raw materials, WIP, or finished goods Safety stock, buffer inventory, obsolete stock JIT delivery, kanban systems 3 Waiting Idle time waiting for materials, information, or equipment Machine downtime, waiting for approvals TPM, better scheduling 4 Transportation Unnecessary movement of materials between processes Long distances between operations, poor layout Cellular layout, co-location 5 Over-processing Doing more work than the customer requires Tighter tolerances than needed, redundant inspections Value engineering, standardization 6 Motion Unnecessary movement of people Reaching, bending, walking to get tools 5S, ergonomic workstations 7 Defects Products that don’t meet specifications Scrap, rework, warranty claims Poka-yoke, root cause analysis Memory Aid: TIMWOOD Use TIMWOOD to remember the seven wastes: Transportation Inventory Motion Waiting Overproduction Over-processing Defects Some people also use DOWNTIME (adding “Non-utilized talent” as an 8th waste). Interactive Exercise: Identify the Waste Scenario 1: A worker walks 50 feet to get a tool, uses it for 30 seconds, then walks back. Answer: This is Motion waste. The solution would be to place tools at the point of use (5S). Scenario 2: A machine produces 1000 parts, but only 800 are needed this week. Answer: This is Overproduction waste. The solution would be to implement pull production based on actual demand. Scenario 3: Parts sit in a queue for 3 days before being processed at the next station. Answer: This is both Inventory and Waiting waste. The solution would be to balance the line and implement one-piece flow. 5.7 The 5S Methodology 5S is a workplace organization methodology that creates a clean, efficient, and safe working environment. Figure 5.6: The 5S Methodology Table 5.5: The 5S Steps Explained Step Japanese English Action Key Question 1S Seiri Sort Remove unnecessary items from the workplace Do we need this? 2S Seiton Set in Order Organize items so they are easy to find and use Where does this belong? 3S Seiso Shine Clean the workplace regularly Is everything clean? 4S Seiketsu Standardize Create standards for maintaining 1S-3S How do we keep it this way? 5S Shitsuke Sustain Build discipline to maintain standards Are we following our standards? 5.7.1 Visual Factory “The ability to understand the status of a production area in 5 minutes or less by simple observation without use of computers or speaking to anyone.” A well-implemented 5S creates a visual factory where problems are immediately apparent. 5.8 Just-in-Time (JIT) Production 5.8.1 The JIT Philosophy “Deliver the right material, in the exact quantity, with perfect quality, in the right place, just before it is needed.” — Ohno and Shingo ## Warning in geom_segment(aes(x = 5.4, xend = 5.9, y = 1, yend = 1), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, : All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 5 ## rows. ## ℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide ## this layer with data containing a single row.

Figure 5.9: Example Kanban Card 5.9 Key Time Metrics Understanding time metrics is essential for lean manufacturing analysis and improvement. 5.9.1 Definitions Figure 5.10: Relationship Between Time Metrics 5.9.2 Formulas and Calculations Takt Time — The pace of production to meet customer demand: \\[\\text{Takt Time} = \\frac{\\text{Available Production Time}}{\\text{Customer Demand}}\\] Cycle Time — Time to complete one unit at a workstation: \\[\\text{Cycle Time} = \\frac{\\text{Net Operating Time}}{\\text{Units Produced}}\\] Throughput Time — Total time from start to finish: \\[\\text{Throughput Time} = \\text{Processing} + \\text{Inspection} + \\text{Queue} + \\text{Move Time}\\] 5.9.3 Interactive Example: Calculating Takt Time # Given data available_time_per_day &lt;- 8 * 60 # 8 hours = 480 minutes breaks_and_meetings &lt;- 60 # 60 minutes for breaks/meetings customer_demand &lt;- 240 # 240 units per day # Calculate net available time net_available_time &lt;- available_time_per_day - breaks_and_meetings cat(&quot;Net Available Time:&quot;, net_available_time, &quot;minutes/day\\n&quot;) ## Net Available Time: 420 minutes/day # Calculate Takt Time takt_time &lt;- net_available_time / customer_demand cat(&quot;Takt Time:&quot;, takt_time, &quot;minutes per unit\\n&quot;) ## Takt Time: 1.75 minutes per unit cat(&quot;Takt Time:&quot;, takt_time * 60, &quot;seconds per unit\\n&quot;) ## Takt Time: 105 seconds per unit # Interpretation cat(&quot;\\n--- Interpretation ---\\n&quot;) ## ## --- Interpretation --- cat(&quot;To meet customer demand, we must produce 1 unit every&quot;, takt_time, &quot;minutes (&quot;, takt_time * 60, &quot;seconds).\\n&quot;) ## To meet customer demand, we must produce 1 unit every 1.75 minutes ( 105 seconds). Practice Problem: Calculate Your Takt Time Given: - Shift length: 10 hours - Two 15-minute breaks and one 30-minute lunch - Customer requires 300 units per shift Calculate: 1. Net available production time 2. Takt time in minutes 3. Takt time in seconds Solution: Net time = (10 × 60) - (15 + 15 + 30) = 600 - 60 = 540 minutes Takt time = 540 / 300 = 1.8 minutes = 108 seconds per unit 5.10 Setup Reduction (SMED) SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Dies) is a methodology developed by Shigeo Shingo to dramatically reduce changeover time. 5.10.1 The SMED Concept Figure 5.11: SMED: Internal vs External Setup 5.10.2 SMED Methodology Table 5.7: The Four Steps of SMED Step Action Description Example 1 Document current process Video the entire changeover, identify all steps Time each step of die change 2 Separate internal and external Internal = machine must be stopped; External = can be done while running Getting tools = external; Removing die = internal 3 Convert internal to external Find ways to perform ‘internal’ tasks while machine is running Pre-stage next die, pre-heat tools 4 Streamline all operations Reduce time for remaining internal tasks through better methods Use quick-release clamps instead of bolts Case Study: Press Setup Reduction Problem: Presses were idle more than 50% of the time due to setup. - Average production run: 1-2 days - Setup time: 1-2 days Root Cause Analysis: - Using standard bolt fasteners with open-end wrenches - No pre-staging of tools or dies - Sequential operations that could be parallel Solutions Implemented: Change Time Saved Socket sets + power tools 10% Quick-release clamps 50% Pre-staging materials 20% Parallel operations 20% Result: Setup time reduced from 1-2 days to 4-6 hours, with a target of under 1 hour. 5.11 Kaizen: Continuous Improvement Kaizen (改善) means “change for the better” — the philosophy of continuous, incremental improvement. 5.11.1 Kaizen Principles Figure 5.12: The Kaizen Continuous Improvement Cycle 5.11.2 Key Kaizen Concepts Everyone participates — from CEO to frontline workers Small, incremental changes — not major overhauls Focus on process — blame the process, not the person Data-driven decisions — measure before and after Standardize improvements — lock in gains 5.12 Value Stream Mapping (VSM) Value Stream Mapping is a lean tool for analyzing the flow of materials and information required to bring a product to the customer. 5.12.1 VSM Symbols Table 5.8: Key Metrics in Value Stream Maps Metric Description Typical Location Process Time (PT) Time to actually process one unit In process box Lead Time (LT) Total time from raw material to finished good Timeline at bottom Changeover Time (C/O) Time to switch between products In process box Uptime Percentage of time equipment is available In process box Takt Time Required pace to meet demand Noted on map WIP Inventory Units waiting between processes Triangle symbol between processes 5.13 Summary Table 5.9: Lean Manufacturing: Key Concepts Summary Concept Definition Key Benefit Lean Manufacturing Systematic elimination of waste Reduced cost, improved quality 3 M’s Muda (waste), Mura (inconsistency), Muri (overburden) Framework for identifying improvement opportunities 7 Wastes TIMWOOD: Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Over-processing, Defects Systematic waste identification 5S Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain Organized, efficient workplace JIT Right part, right quantity, right quality, right place, right time Minimal inventory, fast response Kanban Visual signal system for pull production Controlled WIP, smooth flow SMED Single Minute Exchange of Dies - rapid changeover Flexibility, reduced batch sizes Kaizen Continuous incremental improvement Engaged workforce, sustained improvement 5.14 Review Questions Question 1: What are the seven types of waste, and which is often considered the most impactful? The seven types of waste (TIMWOOD) are: 1. Transportation 2. Inventory 3. Motion 4. Waiting 5. Overproduction 6. Over-processing 7. Defects Inventory is often considered the most impactful because it hides other problems, ties up capital, and can become obsolete. Question 2: Explain the difference between Push and Pull production systems. Push System: - Production based on forecasts - Materials pushed through the system - Results in high inventory - Problems hidden by buffer stock Pull System: - Production triggered by actual demand - Materials pulled by downstream operations - Minimal inventory - Problems immediately visible Question 3: Calculate the Takt time for a facility with 450 minutes of available time and demand of 150 units. \\[\\text{Takt Time} = \\frac{450 \\text{ minutes}}{150 \\text{ units}} = 3 \\text{ minutes per unit}\\] This means we need to produce one unit every 3 minutes (180 seconds) to meet customer demand. Question 4: What is the difference between internal and external setup in SMED? Internal Setup: Activities that can ONLY be performed when the machine is stopped (e.g., physically removing the old die). External Setup: Activities that CAN be performed while the machine is still running (e.g., getting tools, pre-staging the next die, preparing materials). The key to SMED is converting as many internal activities to external as possible. 5.15 References Womack, J., Jones, D., &amp; Roos, D. (1990). The Machine that Changed the World. Ohno, T. (1988).

Before deploying safety devices, the engineer must apply the Hierarchy of Controls — a systematic approach to eliminating or reducing workplace hazards. Figure 6.1: The Hierarchy of Controls (Most to Least Effective) Table 6.1: Hierarchy of Controls: Detailed Breakdown Priority Control Level Description Example Effectiveness 1 Elimination Physically remove the hazard entirely Eliminate pinch point by redesigning mechanism Most Effective 2 Substitution Replace with something less hazardous Use lower voltage (24V DC instead of 120V AC) Very Effective 3 Engineering Controls Isolate people from the hazard through design Install machine guarding, light curtains, interlocks Effective 4 Administrative Controls Change the way people work Safety procedures, training, warning signs, lock-out/tag-out Less Effective 5 PPE Protect the worker with equipment Safety glasses, gloves, steel-toe boots, hearing protection Least Effective Discussion: Why not just rely on PPE? PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) is the least effective control because: It doesn’t eliminate the hazard — the danger still exists It depends on human compliance — workers may forget or choose not to wear it It can fail — equipment degrades, doesn’t fit properly, or is damaged It’s the last line of defense — if PPE fails, the worker is exposed Key Principle: The more we can design out hazards through engineering controls, the less we depend on human behavior to keep people safe. “If you have to post a warning sign, you’ve already failed at design.” 6.3 Physical Guarding and Interlocks Physical barriers are the most intuitive form of protection. They create a “hard” separation between the operator and moving parts, ensuring that humans cannot enter the danger zone during machine operation. Figure 6.2: Types of Physical Guarding 6.3.1 Fixed Guards Fixed guards are permanent barriers that require tools to remove. They are the simplest and most reliable form of protection. Table 6.2: Fixed Guards: Key Characteristics Characteristic Description Construction Wire mesh, polycarbonate sheets, or solid metal panels Removal Requires tools (screws, bolts) to remove Best Application Areas that need infrequent access for maintenance only Advantages Simple, reliable, low cost, no moving parts to fail Disadvantages Impedes visibility, slows maintenance, can be removed and not replaced 6.3.2 Interlocked Guards Interlocked guards are access points equipped with sensors. When the guard is opened, the safety controller initiates a stop. Figure 6.3: Interlocked Guard Operation Principle 6.3.3 Stop Categories When an interlock is triggered, the machine must stop. The stop category determines how this happens: Table 6.3: Machine Stop Categories (IEC 60204-1) Category Type Method Application Example Category 0 Uncontrolled Stop Immediate removal of power to actuators Emergency stops, dangerous machines Press brake E-stop Category 1 Controlled Stop Controlled deceleration, then power removed High-inertia machines, robots Industrial robot guard open Category 2 Controlled Stop Controlled stop with power maintained Process that cannot be interrupted abruptly CNC spindle during tool change 6.3.4 Trapped Key Systems (Lock-Out/Tag-Out) Trapped key systems use a mechanical sequence to ensure that a machine cannot be energized unless all access keys are returned to the control panel. Figure 6.4: Trapped Key System Sequence Case Study: The Fatal Bypass Incident: A maintenance worker was killed when a robot arm unexpectedly activated while he was inside a robotic cell. What Happened: - The guard interlock had been bypassed with a “defeat device” (a magnet taped to fool the sensor) - Workers had bypassed the interlock because it slowed down troubleshooting - The bypass had been in place for months without management knowledge Root Causes: 1. Interlock caused inconvenience during frequent troubleshooting 2. No monitoring system to detect bypasses 3. Culture that tolerated “workarounds” Lessons Learned: - Design interlocks that don’t impede normal operations - Use tamper-evident or tamper-resistant devices - Regular safety audits to detect bypasses - Zero-tolerance policy for defeating safety devices Never bypass a safety device, even temporarily. 6.4 Presence-Sensing Devices Presence-sensing devices allow for a “fence-less” environment, improving visibility and ergonomics while maintaining high safety levels. They detect when a person enters a hazardous zone and trigger a machine stop. Figure 6.5: Types of Presence-Sensing Devices 6.4.1 Light Curtains Light curtains use a transmitter and receiver to create an array of infrared beams. If any beam is broken, the safety circuit is interrupted. Figure 6.6: Light Curtain Operating Principle Table 6.4: Light Curtain Specifications by Application Parameter Finger Detection (14mm) Hand Detection (30mm) Body Detection (40mm+) Resolution 14mm beam spacing 30mm beam spacing 40mm+ beam spacing Height 150-1800mm 300-1800mm 900-2000mm Range 0.5-20m 0.5-20m 0.5-30m Response Time 5-15ms 10-20ms 15-30ms Application Point of operation guarding Perimeter guarding Area access detection 6.4.2 Laser Area Scanners Laser area scanners use LiDAR technology to monitor a 2D plane. They are highly flexible and allow for programmable zones. Figure 6.7: Laser Area Scanner Zones Table 6.5: Light Curtains vs. Area Scanners Feature Light Curtains Area Scanners Detection Type Vertical/Linear Barrier Horizontal/Area Coverage Flexibility Fixed installation Programmable zones Zone Configuration Single detection plane Multiple warning + safety zones Cost Generally lower ($1,000-5,000) Higher ($3,000-10,000) Best Use Case Clear entry/exit points, press brakes Large open floors, AGV paths, flexible cells Environmental Limits Dust/debris can cause false trips More tolerant of dust, outdoor rated available 6.4.3 Pressure-Sensitive Safety Mats Pressure-sensitive mats detect the presence of a person standing on them. They are used primarily in legacy systems or specific zones where optical sensors may be obscured. Figure 6.8: Pressure-Sensitive Safety Mat Construction When to Use Pressure Mats vs. Optical Sensors Use Pressure Mats When: - Environment has heavy dust, smoke, or steam (blinds optical sensors) - Detection area is well-defined and doesn’t change - Workers need to stand in a specific location - Budget is limited Use Optical Sensors When: - Flexibility in zone configuration is needed - Environment is relatively clean - Detection area is large or needs to change - Higher integrity level is required Hybrid Approach: Many modern systems use both — area scanners for perimeter protection and pressure mats for specific danger zones near the machine. 6.5 Control-Actuated Safety Devices These devices ensure that the operator’s body—specifically their hands—is in a predetermined safe location before the machine can cycle. 6.5.1 Two-Hand Controls Two-hand controls are common in pressing or stamping operations. To initiate a cycle, the operator must press two buttons simultaneously. Figure 6.9: Two-Hand Control System Anti-Tie-Down Requirement: Modern systems require both buttons to be pressed within 0.5 seconds of each other. This prevents operators from taping one button down to work with one hand. Table 6.6: Two-Hand Control Requirements Requirement Standard Value Purpose Synchronous activation Within 0.5 seconds Prevents one-hand operation Continuous pressure Must be held throughout cycle Ensures hands stay on controls Release before restart Both must be released before next cycle Prevents automatic cycling Button spacing Minimum 260mm (10 inches) apart Cannot press both with one hand/arm Guards around buttons Prevent accidental activation Prevents hip, elbow, or object activation 6.5.2 Enable/Deadman Switches Enable switches (also called deadman switches) are used during Teach Mode for robotics. The operator must hold a three-position trigger in the middle position. Figure 6.10: Three-Position Enable Switch Operation Why Three Positions? The three-position design accounts for two natural human reactions to danger: Panic (Release): When frightened, people often release what they’re holding — robot stops. Startle (Squeeze): When startled, people often grip tighter — robot stops. Only a deliberate, controlled middle hold allows the robot to move. This is fundamental to safe teach pendant operation. 6.6 Collaborative Robotics (Cobots) Collaborative robots (cobots) represent a shift from “separation” to “collaboration.” They rely on sophisticated internal sensors rather than external cages, allowing humans and robots to work in the same space. Figure 6.11: Traditional Robot vs. Collaborative Robot 6.6.1 Collaborative Operation Methods ISO 10218 and ISO/TS 15066 define four methods for safe collaborative operation: Table 6.7: Four Methods of Collaborative Robot Operation Method How It Works Sensors Used Application Safety-Rated Monitored Stop Robot stops when human enters workspace, resumes when clear Area scanners, light curtains Large robot needing occasional access Hand Guiding Operator physically guides robot through motions Force/torque sensors in joints Teaching, positioning Speed and Separation Monitoring Robot slows or stops based on human proximity Area scanners, radar, cameras Shared workspace with varying proximity Power and Force Limiting Robot limits force/power to safe levels on contact Joint torque sensors Direct contact applications 6.6.2 Power and Force Limiting (PFL) The most common cobot safety method is Power and Force Limiting. The robot detects a change in torque in its joints. If it bumps into a human, it stops before a regulated amount of force is exceeded. Table 6.8: ISO/TS 15066 Biomechanical Limits (Quasi-static contact) Body Region Maximum Pressure (N/cm²) Maximum Force (N) Risk Level Skull/Forehead 130 130 Critical Face 65 65 Critical Neck 145 150 Critical Back/Shoulders 210 210 Moderate Chest 140 140 Moderate Abdomen 110 110 Moderate Hand/Fingers 300 140 Lower Discussion: Are Cobots Always Safe? Common Misconception: “Cobots are safe, so we don’t need to do a risk assessment.” Reality: Cobots are potentially safe, but a risk assessment is always required. Factors that can make a cobot unsafe: End-of-arm tooling — A soft gripper is different from a sharp blade Workpiece — Carrying a heavy or sharp object increases risk Speed — Even force-limited robots can cause injury at high speed Application — Some tasks bring humans closer to hazards Environment — Slippery floors, confined spaces, etc. Every collaborative application requires a documented risk assessment per ISO 12100. 6.7 Safety Distance Calculation A safety device cannot be placed arbitrarily. It must be far enough away that the machine comes to a complete halt before the human can reach the hazard. 6.7.1 The Safety Distance Formula The minimum safety distance \\(S\\) is calculated as: \\[S = (K \\times T) + C\\] Where: \\(K\\): The hand/body approach speed (standardized values) \\(T\\): The total stopping time of the system (device response + machine stop time) \\(C\\): The “penetration depth” (how far a hand can reach through before being detected) Figure 6.12: Safety Distance Components 6.7.2 Standard Values for K Table 6.9: Standard Approach Speed Values (ISO 13855) Approach Type K Value (mm/s) When to Use Hand/Arm Approach (fast) 2000 Close approach to point of operation Hand/Arm Approach (normal) 1600 General approach to machines Walking Approach 1600 Area access detection Standing Reach 0 (static) Worker already in position 6.7.3 Penetration Depth (C) The penetration depth depends on the resolution of the sensing device: Table 6.10: Penetration Depth Values Based on Resolution Resolution (mm) C Value (mm) Detection Type ≤14 0 Finger detection &gt;14 to ≤20 80 Finger/Hand &gt;20 to ≤30 130 Hand detection &gt;30 to ≤40 240 Hand/Arm &gt;40 850 Body detection 6.7.4 Example Calculation # Given parameters K &lt;- 2000 # Approach speed (mm/s) - fast hand approach T_device &lt;- 0.020 # Light curtain response time (20 ms = 0.020 s) T_machine &lt;- 0.150 # Machine stopping time (150 ms = 0.150 s) C &lt;- 0 # Penetration depth for 14mm resolution # Calculate total stopping time T_total &lt;- T_device + T_machine cat(&quot;Total stopping time (T):&quot;, T_total * 1000, &quot;ms\\n&quot;) ## Total stopping time (T): 170 ms # Calculate minimum safety distance S &lt;- (K * T_total) + C cat(&quot;Minimum safety distance (S):&quot;, S, &quot;mm\\n&quot;) ## Minimum safety distance (S): 340 mm cat(&quot;Minimum safety distance (S):&quot;, S / 25.4, &quot;inches\\n&quot;) ## Minimum safety distance (S): 13.38583 inches # Interpretation cat(&quot;\\n--- Interpretation ---\\n&quot;) ## ## --- Interpretation --- cat(&quot;The light curtain must be at least&quot;, S, &quot;mm from the hazard.\\n&quot;) ## The light curtain must be at least 340 mm from the hazard. cat(&quot;This ensures the machine stops before a person can reach the danger zone.\\n&quot;) ## This ensures the machine stops before a person can reach the danger zone. Practice Problem: Calculate Safety Distance Given: - Light curtain resolution: 30mm (hand detection) - Light curtain response time: 15ms - Machine stopping time: 200ms - Application: Operator hand approach Calculate the minimum safety distance. Solution: K = 1600 mm/s (normal hand approach) T = 0.015 + 0.200 = 0.215 seconds C = 130 mm (for 30mm resolution) S = (K × T) + C S = (1600 × 0.215) + 130 S = 344 + 130 S = 474 mm (approximately 18.7 inches) The light curtain must be installed at least 474mm from the nearest hazard point. 6.8 Emergency Stop (E-Stop) Systems The Emergency Stop is the “last resort” — it is not a safety device but a complementary protective measure. It must be available to stop the machine when all other measures have failed. Figure 6.13: E-Stop Design Requirements Table 6.11: E-Stop Requirements per IEC 60204-1 Requirement Standard Color Red (RAL 3000 or equivalent) Shape Mushroom head (palm or fist operated) Background Yellow (high contrast) Operation Self-latching (stays activated when pressed) Reset Manual reset required (twist, pull, or key) Accessibility Within easy reach of all operators Wiring Normally closed contacts (fail-safe) Function Category 0 or Category 1 stop 6.8.1 E-Stop Pull Cords For long conveyors or machines where an operator cannot quickly reach a fixed button, pull cords provide continuous E-Stop coverage. Figure 6.14: E-Stop Pull Cord System Common E-Stop Mistakes Mistake 1: Using E-Stop for normal stopping - E-Stops are for emergencies only - Normal stops should use a separate control - Frequent E-Stop use causes wear and desensitizes operators Mistake 2: E-Stop that doesn’t stop everything - All hazardous motion must stop - Auxiliary equipment (conveyors, feeders) often forgotten - Review entire system, not just the primary machine Mistake 3: Automatic restart after E-Stop reset - Machine must NOT automatically restart when E-Stop is released - Separate “Start” action required - This prevents unexpected motion after reset Mistake 4: Hidden or blocked E-Stops - E-Stops must be visible and accessible - Guard placement sometimes blocks access - Regular audits needed to ensure accessibility 6.9 Functional Safety Standards Modern safety systems must meet specific performance levels to ensure reliability. Two main frameworks exist: 6.9.1 Safety Integrity Levels (SIL) - IEC 62061 Table 6.12: Safety Integrity Levels (PFH = Probability of Dangerous Failure per Hour) SIL Level PFH Range Approximate Meaning Typical Application SIL 1 ≥10⁻⁶ to &lt;10⁻⁵ Dangerous failure less than once per 11 years Low-risk tasks SIL 2 ≥10⁻⁷ to &lt;10⁻⁶ Dangerous failure less than once per 114 years Most industrial machinery SIL 3 ≥10⁻⁸ to &lt;10⁻⁷ Dangerous failure less than once per 1,140 years High-risk processes 6.9.2 Performance Levels (PL) - ISO 13849-1 Table 6.13: Performance Levels per ISO 13849-1 Performance Level PFH Range Risk Reduction Equivalent SIL PL a ≥10⁻⁵ to &lt;10⁻⁴ Lowest &lt; SIL 1 PL b ≥3×10⁻⁶ to &lt;10⁻⁵ Low SIL 1 PL c ≥10⁻⁶ to &lt;3×10⁻⁶ Medium SIL 1 PL d ≥10⁻⁷ to &lt;10⁻⁶ High SIL 2 PL e ≥10⁻⁸ to &lt;10⁻⁷ Highest SIL 3 Figure 6.15: Relationship Between SIL and PL Which Standard to Use: SIL or PL? Use ISO 13849-1 (Performance Levels) when: - Designing safety functions for standard machinery - Using off-the-shelf safety components - Simpler systems with well-defined safety functions Use IEC 62061 (SIL) when: - Complex programmable systems (safety PLCs) - Process industries - When customer or regulation specifies SIL Note: Many modern systems use both standards, as they are harmonized and can be used together. The choice often depends on industry practice and customer requirements. 6.10 Risk Assessment Process Before selecting any safety device, a risk assessment must be performed. This is required by ISO 12100. Figure 6.16: Risk Assessment Process (ISO 12100) 6.10.1 Risk Estimation Risk is typically estimated using three factors: Figure 6.17: Risk Estimation Matrix 6.11 Summary Table 6.14: Machine Guarding and Safety: Key Concepts Summary Topic Key Points Critical Remember Hierarchy of Controls Elimination &gt; Substitution &gt; Engineering &gt; Administrative &gt; PPE Always start at the top of the hierarchy Physical Guarding Fixed guards, interlocked gates, trapped key systems Stop category (0, 1, 2) determines how machine stops Presence Sensing Light curtains, area scanners, pressure mats Resolution determines detection capability Control-Actuated Devices Two-hand controls, enable/deadman switches Anti-tie-down prevents one-hand bypass Collaborative Robots PFL, speed/separation monitoring, hand guiding Risk assessment required for every cobot application Safety Distance S = (K × T) + C formula for device placement Include device response AND machine stop time E-Stop Systems Red mushroom on yellow, self-latching, manual reset E-Stop is last resort, not normal operation Functional Safety SIL (IEC 62061) and PL (ISO 13849-1) standards Required performance level from risk assessment 6.12 Review Questions Question 1: What are the five levels of the Hierarchy of Controls, and why is PPE the least effective? The five levels are (from most to least effective): Elimination — Physically remove the hazard Substitution — Replace with something less hazardous Engineering Controls — Isolate people from the hazard Administrative Controls — Change how people work PPE — Protect the worker with equipment PPE is least effective because: - The hazard still exists - It depends on human compliance - Equipment can fail or be worn incorrectly - It’s the last line of defense Question 2: A light curtain has a response time of 12ms and resolution of 14mm. The machine takes 180ms to stop. Calculate the minimum safety distance for hand approach. Given: - K = 2000 mm/s (hand approach, use higher value for safety) - T = 0.012 + 0.180 = 0.192 seconds - C = 0 mm (14mm resolution) Calculation: \\[S = (K \\times T) + C\\] \\[S = (2000 \\times 0.192) + 0\\] \\[S = 384 \\text{ mm}\\] The light curtain must be installed at least 384mm (approximately 15 inches) from the hazard. Question 3: Explain why a three-position enable switch stops the robot in both position 1 (released) and position 3 (fully pressed). The three-position design accounts for two natural human reactions to danger: Position 1 (Released): - When frightened, people often release what they’re holding (panic response) - Robot stops immediately Position 3 (Fully Pressed): - When startled, people often grip tighter (startle response) - Robot stops immediately Position 2 (Middle): - Only a deliberate, controlled hold allows operation - Requires conscious effort to maintain - This ensures the operator is alert and in control Question 4: What are the four methods of collaborative robot operation according to ISO 10218? Safety-Rated Monitored Stop Robot stops when human enters workspace Resumes when human leaves Uses area scanners or light curtains Hand Guiding Operator physically guides robot Force/torque sensors enable safe teaching Speed and Separation Monitoring Robot speed varies based on human proximity Uses external sensors to track human position Power and Force Limiting (PFL) Robot limits contact force to safe levels Built-in joint torque sensors Most common cobot method Question 5: What are the requirements for an E-Stop button according to IEC 60204-1? Physical Requirements: - Color: Red - Shape: Mushroom head (palm or fist operated) - Background: Yellow (high contrast) Functional Requirements: - Self-latching: Stays activated when pressed - Manual reset: Requires deliberate action to release - Accessibility: Within easy reach of all operators - Wiring: Normally closed contacts (fail-safe) - Function: Category 0 or Category 1 stop - No automatic restart: Separate start action required after reset 6.13 References ISO 12100:2010 — Safety of machinery — General principles for design — Risk assessment and risk reduction ISO 13849-1:2015 — Safety of machinery — Safety-related parts of control systems ISO 13855:2010 — Safety of machinery — Positioning of safeguards with respect to approach speeds ISO 10218-1/2:2011 — Robots and robotic devices — Safety requirements for industrial robots ISO/TS 15066:2016 — Robots and robotic devices — Collaborative robots IEC 60204-1:2016 — Safety of machinery — Electrical equipment of machines IEC 62061:2021 — Safety of machinery — Functional safety of safety-related control systems OSHA 29 CFR 1910.212 — General requirements for all machines ANSI/RIA TR R15.306 — Task-based risk assessment methodology "],["ergonomics-in-automated-manufacturing.html", "Chapter 7 Ergonomics in Automated Manufacturing 7.1 Learning Objectives 7.2 What is Ergonomics? 7.3 The Seven Ergonomic Risk Factors 7.4 Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) 7.5 Preventing MSDs: Best Practices 7.6 Ergonomic Design Principles 7.7 Ergonomic Assessment Tools 7.8 AI-Powered Ergonomic Assessment 7.9 Ergonomics in Automated Manufacturing 7.10 Employer Responsibilities 7.11 Case Study: Ergonomics in Automated Assembly 7.12 Summary 7.13 Review Questions 7.14 Additional Resources 7.15 References", " Chapter 7 Ergonomics in Automated Manufacturing 7.1 Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will be able to: Define ergonomics and explain its importance in manufacturing Identify the seven major ergonomic risk factors Recognize common musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and their causes Apply ergonomic design principles to workstation design Conduct a REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment) analysis Understand the role of AI and automation in ergonomic assessment Design workstations that optimize human performance and safety “Ergonomics is the science of fitting the job to the worker, not forcing the worker to fit the job.” — International Ergonomics Association 7.2 What is Ergonomics? Ergonomics (from Greek ergon = work, nomos = laws) is the scientific discipline focused on understanding the interactions between humans and other elements of a system, with the goal of optimizing human well-being and overall system performance. Figure 7.1: The Three Domains of Ergonomics Table 7.1: The Three Domains of Ergonomics Domain Focus Key Topics Manufacturing Example Physical Ergonomics Human body’s response to physical stress Posture, material handling, repetitive motion, workplace layout, safety Designing assembly workstations to reduce reaching Cognitive Ergonomics Mental processes and human-system interaction Mental workload, decision-making, human-computer interaction, training Designing HMI screens for quick comprehension Organizational Ergonomics Optimization of sociotechnical systems Communication, teamwork, work schedules, quality management Implementing job rotation to reduce fatigue 7.2.1 Why Ergonomics Matters in Manufacturing Figure 7.2: The Business Case for Ergonomics The Cost of Ignoring Ergonomics Direct Costs: - Workers’ compensation claims - Medical expenses - Legal fees - Increased insurance premiums Indirect Costs (often 4-10x direct costs): - Lost productivity - Training replacement workers - Reduced quality - Overtime to cover absent workers - Administrative time - Low morale Statistics: - MSDs account for 33% of all workplace injuries - Average MSD claim costs $15,000-$20,000 - Lost workdays due to MSDs average 12 days per case - Carpal tunnel surgery costs approximately $30,000 per case (including lost time) 7.3 The Seven Ergonomic Risk Factors The Initial Ergonomic Risk Assessment (INERA) identifies seven primary risk factors that contribute to musculoskeletal disorders. Understanding these factors is the first step in prevention. Figure 7.3: The Seven Ergonomic Risk Factors Table 7.2: The Seven Ergonomic Risk Factors Explained # Risk Factor Definition Examples Body Areas Affected 1 Awkward Postures Positions that deviate from neutral body alignment Bent wrist, raised arms, twisted back, kneeling Back, neck, shoulders, wrists, knees 2 Repetition Performing the same motion repeatedly Assembly line tasks, typing, packaging Hands, wrists, shoulders, neck 3 Force Amount of physical effort required to do a task Lifting heavy objects, pushing/pulling, gripping tools Back, shoulders, hands, arms 4 Static Positions Maintaining the same position for extended periods Standing in one spot, holding arms overhead Legs, back, shoulders, neck 5 Contact Stress Pressure from hard surfaces or edges on body tissues Resting wrists on desk edge, kneeling on hard floor Hands, knees, forearms 6 Vibration Oscillating movements transferred to the body Power tools, driving forklifts, jackhammers Hands, arms, spine 7 Environmental Factors Temperature, lighting, noise affecting work performance Cold environments, poor lighting, excessive noise Eyes, ears, overall fatigue 7.3.1 Risk Factor 1: Awkward Postures Neutral posture is the position where joints are naturally aligned, minimizing stress on muscles, tendons, and skeletal system. Any deviation from neutral increases injury risk. Figure 7.4: Posture Risk Zones Table 7.3: Neutral vs. Awkward Postures by Body Part Body Part Neutral Position Awkward Position Risk Head/Neck Balanced on spine, looking straight ahead Bent forward &gt;20°, tilted, twisted Neck pain, headaches Shoulders Relaxed, arms at sides Raised, reaching overhead, behind body Shoulder impingement, rotator cuff Elbows Close to body, bent 90-120° Fully extended or tightly bent Tennis elbow, golfer’s elbow Wrists Straight, in line with forearm Bent up/down, twisted side-to-side Carpal tunnel, tendinitis Back Natural S-curve maintained Bent forward, twisted, arched Low back pain, disc herniation Hips/Knees Thighs parallel to floor, feet flat Squatting, kneeling, twisted Knee injuries, hip pain 7.3.2 Risk Factor 2: Repetition Repetitive motion is one of the most significant risk factors in manufacturing. The risk increases with: Frequency: How often the motion occurs Duration: How long the task is performed Recovery time: Rest between repetitions Table 7.4: Repetition Risk Thresholds Cycle Time Repetitions/Hour Risk Level Action Required &gt; 30 seconds &lt; 120 Low Monitor 15-30 seconds 120-240 Moderate Investigate and consider changes &lt; 15 seconds &gt; 240 High Immediate intervention needed 7.3.3 Risk Factor 3: Force The amount of physical effort required significantly impacts injury risk. Force requirements depend on: Figure 7.5: Factors Affecting Force Requirements Interactive Exercise: Identify the Risk Factors Scenario: An assembly line worker performs the following task 400 times per shift: Reaches overhead to grab a part from a bin Holds the part while inserting 4 screws with a power screwdriver Places the completed assembly on a conveyor The workstation has poor lighting and the floor is concrete Identify all risk factors present: Answer: 1. Awkward Posture - Reaching overhead 2. Repetition - 400 cycles per shift 3. Force - Gripping parts, controlling screwdriver 4. Static Position - Holding part during assembly 5. Vibration - Power screwdriver 6. Contact Stress - Standing on concrete (feet) 7. Environmental - Poor lighting This task has ALL SEVEN risk factors present! 7.4 Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) are injuries and disorders affecting muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage, and spinal discs. They are the most common and costly occupational health problem. Figure 7.6: Common MSDs by Body Region Table 7.5: Common Musculoskeletal Disorders in Manufacturing Disorder Description Causes Symptoms Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Compression of median nerve in the wrist Repetitive wrist motions, forceful gripping, vibration Numbness, tingling, weakness in hand Tendinitis Inflammation of tendons from overuse Repetitive motions, awkward postures, force Pain, swelling, stiffness in affected area Low Back Pain Strain or injury to muscles/discs of lower back Heavy lifting, bending, twisting, vibration Pain, stiffness, limited mobility Rotator Cuff Injury Damage to shoulder tendons Overhead work, repetitive shoulder motion Pain, weakness, limited range of motion Epicondylitis Inflammation of elbow tendons (tennis/golfer’s elbow) Repetitive arm/wrist motions, forceful gripping Pain on outside (tennis) or inside (golfer’s) of elbow Trigger Finger Finger gets stuck in bent position Repetitive gripping, hand tools Clicking, locking of finger 7.4.1 The MSD Development Cycle MSDs typically develop gradually through a predictable cycle: Figure 7.7: The MSD Development Cycle Warning Signs: When to Take Action Early Warning Signs (Act Immediately): - Persistent fatigue in specific body parts - Discomfort during or after work - Tightness or stiffness - Minor aching or soreness Serious Warning Signs (Seek Medical Attention): - Persistent pain that doesn’t go away with rest - Numbness or tingling - Loss of strength or grip - Swelling or inflammation - Reduced range of motion - Pain that wakes you at night Key Message: Report symptoms early! The earlier the intervention, the better the outcome. 7.5 Preventing MSDs: Best Practices Prevention is far more effective and less costly than treatment. Here are evidence-based strategies for MSD prevention: Figure 7.8: MSD Prevention Hierarchy Table 7.6: MSD Prevention Strategies Strategy Engineering Solutions Worker Actions Maintain Neutral Posture Adjustable workstations, proper tool selection Awareness of body position, stretching Reduce Repetition Automation, job rotation between stations Vary tasks when possible Minimize Force Mechanical assists, better handles, lighter parts Use tools properly, ask for help with heavy items Avoid Static Positions Sit-stand workstations, adjustable fixtures Shift weight, change positions frequently Eliminate Contact Stress Padding, rounded edges, anti-fatigue mats Use padding, wear appropriate PPE Control Vibration Vibration-dampening tools, isolation mounts Limit exposure time, grip tools lightly Optimize Environment Proper lighting, climate control, noise reduction Report issues, use available controls Allow Recovery Rest break areas, micro-break reminders Take breaks, report fatigue 7.5.1 Proper Lifting Technique Improper lifting is a leading cause of back injuries. The NIOSH lifting equation provides guidelines, but proper technique is fundamental. Figure 7.9: Proper Lifting Technique 7.6 Ergonomic Design Principles Effective ergonomic design follows established principles that account for human capabilities and limitations. Figure 7.10: Ergonomic Design Principles Table 7.7: Ergonomic Design Principles in Detail Principle Description Implementation 1. Neutral Posture Design to promote natural, balanced body positions Adjustable workstations, proper tool angles, monitor height 2. Accommodate Anthropometry Accommodate different body sizes (5th-95th percentile) Adjustable equipment, multiple sizes available, reach considerations 3. Reduce Excessive Force Minimize force requirements for all tasks Mechanical assists, better handles, reduce weight, improve grip 4. Reduce Excessive Motion Reduce extreme motions, frequencies, and durations Bring work closer, eliminate unnecessary steps, use fixtures 5. Optimize Work Height Match work surface height to task requirements Precision work higher, heavy work lower, adjustable surfaces 6. Minimize Static Load Avoid holding same position for extended periods Support arms, provide seating options, allow movement 7. Environmental Conditions Optimize lighting, temperature, noise, air quality Task lighting, climate control, noise barriers, ventilation 8. Cognitive Support Design interfaces for easy understanding and use Clear displays, logical controls, consistent feedback 7.6.1 Anthropometry: Designing for Human Dimensions Anthropometry is the scientific study of human body measurements. Workstations must accommodate the range of workers who will use them. Figure 7.11: Anthropometric Design Considerations Table 7.8: Key Anthropometric Measurements for Workstation Design Measurement 5th % Female (cm) 50th % Combined (cm) 95th % Male (cm) Design Application Stature (Standing Height) 150 170 188 Overhead clearance, door height Eye Height (Standing) 138 158 176 Display/sign height Shoulder Height 121 140 158 Shelf maximum height Elbow Height 93 104 117 Work surface height (standing) Knuckle Height 64 74 85 Handle height for pulling Sitting Height 79 87 97 Overhead clearance (seated) Seated Eye Height 68 76 85 Monitor height (seated) Seated Elbow Height 18 24 31 Armrest, work surface height Thigh Clearance 12 15 19 Under-desk clearance Forward Reach 64 73 84 Maximum reach distance 7.6.2 Work Surface Height Guidelines Figure 7.12: Recommended Work Surface Heights Discussion: Why Different Heights for Different Tasks? Precision Work (100-110 cm): - Requires close visual inspection - Hands need to be at or above eye level - Examples: Electronics assembly, inspection, watchmaking Light Assembly (85-95 cm): - General manipulation tasks - Hands at about elbow height - Examples: Packaging, general assembly, sorting Heavy Work (70-85 cm): - Requires pushing, pressing, or lifting - Lower height allows use of body weight - Examples: Packing boxes, pressing operations, heavy assembly Key Principle: The work surface height should allow the worker to maintain neutral posture while performing the specific task. 7.7 Ergonomic Assessment Tools Several standardized tools help assess ergonomic risk and guide interventions. Understanding these tools is essential for the process engineer.

The seven ergonomic risk factors are: 1. Awkward Postures 2. Repetition 3. Force 4. Static Positions 5. Contact Stress 6. Vibration 7. Environmental Factors Carpal tunnel syndrome is most commonly associated with: - Repetition - Repeated wrist movements compress the median nerve - Force - Forceful gripping increases pressure in the carpal tunnel - Also contributing: awkward wrist postures and vibration Question 2: A worker performs a task 8 times per minute for a 4-hour shift. The cycle time is 7.5 seconds. Is this considered high repetition? Why? Analysis: - Cycle time: 7.5 seconds (&lt; 15 seconds threshold) - Repetitions per hour: 8 × 60 = 480 (&gt; 240 threshold) Yes, this is HIGH repetition because: 1. Cycle time is less than 15 seconds 2. Repetitions exceed 240 per hour Risk Level: High - Immediate intervention needed Recommended actions: - Job rotation with different tasks - Automation of repetitive elements - Micro-breaks every 20-30 minutes - Workstation redesign to reduce cycle elements Question 3: Explain why ergonomic design should accommodate the 5th to 95th percentile of the population rather than designing for the “average” person. Designing for the average excludes most people: - The “average” person in ALL dimensions doesn’t exist - A person may be average height but have long arms or short legs - Designing for only the 50th percentile fits only about 50% of users The 5th-95th percentile range: - Accommodates 90% of the population - Addresses both small and large users - Provides adjustability rather than fixed dimensions Application rules: - Clearances (overhead, legroom): Design for 95th percentile (largest) - Reach distances: Design for 5th percentile (smallest) - Work surfaces: Make adjustable to accommodate range Example: A fixed workstation at 95cm height: - Too high for 5th percentile female (elbow at ~93cm) - Too low for 95th percentile male (elbow at ~117cm) - Adjustable range of 85-115cm accommodates both Question 4: Calculate the NIOSH Lifting Index for the following task and determine if intervention is needed. Task Parameters: - Horizontal distance (H): 35 cm - Vertical height (V): 80 cm - Travel distance (D): 50 cm - Asymmetry (A): 0° (symmetric lift) - Frequency: 4 lifts/minute for 1 hour - Coupling: Good (handles) - Actual load: 18 kg Solution: LC = 23 kg HM = 25/35 = 0.714 VM = 1 - 0.003|80-75| = 0.985 DM = 0.82 + 4.5/50 = 0.91 AM = 1 - 0.0032(0) = 1.0 FM = 0.75 (4/min, 1 hour, V&gt;75cm, from table) CM = 1.0 (good coupling) RWL = 23 × 0.714 × 0.985 × 0.91 × 1.0 × 0.75 × 1.0 RWL = 11.0 kg LI = 18 / 11.0 = 1.64 Risk Level: MODERATE (1.0 &lt; LI &lt; 2.0) Action: Some workers may be at risk - consider changes Recommendations: - Reduce horizontal distance (bring load closer) - Reduce lifting frequency - Use mechanical assist for loads &gt;12 kg Question 5: What are three advantages of AI-powered ergonomic assessment over traditional methods? 1. Scale and Coverage: - Traditional: 5-10 assessments per day by trained ergonomist - AI: Hundreds or thousands of assessments simultaneously - Can monitor entire facility continuously 2.

Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA) is a systematic, proactive method for evaluating a manufacturing or business process to identify where and how it might fail, and to assess the relative impact of different failures. The goal is to identify and prioritize actions that will prevent defects before they occur. Figure 8.1: PFMEA: A Proactive Quality Tool 8.2.2 Brief History of FMEA Table 8.1: Evolution of FMEA Year Development Significance 1949 US Military develops FMEA (MIL-P-1629) First formal FMEA methodology 1960s NASA adopts FMEA for Apollo program Proven reliability in life-critical systems 1970s Automotive industry begins using FMEA Ford, GM, Chrysler adoption drives standardization 1980s AIAG publishes first FMEA manual Industry-wide consistency established 1990s QS-9000 requires FMEA for automotive suppliers FMEA becomes mandatory in supply chain 2000s FMEA expands to healthcare, service industries Methodology proves universal applicability 2019 AIAG-VDA FMEA Handbook published (current standard) Harmonized global standard, introduces AP method 8.2.3 DFMEA vs. PFMEA Two main types of FMEA are used in product development: Figure 8.2: DFMEA vs PFMEA: Different Focus, Same Methodology Table 8.2: DFMEA vs PFMEA Comparison Aspect DFMEA (Design) PFMEA (Process) Primary Question Will the design meet requirements? Will the process produce conforming parts? Failure Mode Example Shaft diameter too small Shaft turned undersize Effect Example Premature bearing failure Part fails incoming inspection Cause Example Inadequate stress analysis Tool wear not monitored Control Example FEA simulation, prototype testing In-process gauging, SPC Responsible Team Design engineering, R&amp;D Manufacturing, quality, production Question: When should PFMEA be conducted? Ideal Timing for PFMEA: New Process Development: Before production begins, during process design New Product Introduction: When a new product will use existing processes Process Changes: Whenever significant changes are made to equipment, methods, or materials Quality Issues: When field failures or customer complaints indicate process problems Regular Review: Periodically (annually) to ensure continued relevance Key Principle: The earlier PFMEA is conducted, the lower the cost of implementing improvements. Changes during design cost 10x less than changes during production, and 100x less than changes after customer delivery. 8.2.4 Why PFMEA Matters Figure 8.3: Benefits of PFMEA Implementation 8.3 PFMEA Fundamentals 8.3.1 Core Objectives The fundamental objective of PFMEA is prevention over detection — identifying and eliminating potential failures before they occur, rather than finding defects after production. Table 8.3: Core Objectives of PFMEA Objective Description Outcome Identify Failure Modes Systematically identify all ways the process can fail Comprehensive list of potential problems Assess Risk Evaluate severity, likelihood, and detectability of each failure Quantified risk scores (RPN or AP) Prioritize Actions Focus resources on highest-risk failure modes Action plan focused on critical issues Document Knowledge Capture institutional knowledge in a structured format Living document for continuous improvement Drive Improvement Implement and verify effectiveness of countermeasures Measurable reduction in process risk 8.3.2 The PFMEA Team PFMEA is most effective when conducted by a cross-functional team. No single person has all the knowledge needed to identify every potential failure. Figure 8.4: PFMEA Cross-Functional Team Question: Why is a cross-functional team essential? A cross-functional team is essential because: Diverse Knowledge: No single person understands all aspects of the process Different Perspectives: Quality sees defects, production sees constraints, maintenance sees failures Buy-in: People support what they help create Historical Knowledge: Operators often know about problems never formally documented System Thinking: Process interactions are visible when multiple functions participate Common Mistake: Having one engineer complete PFMEA alone as a “paperwork exercise.” This misses critical failure modes and produces an ineffective document. Best Practice: Minimum 4-6 team members, including at least one person with hands-on process experience. 8.3.3 Key Terminology Understanding PFMEA terminology is essential for effective analysis: Table 8.4: PFMEA Key Terminology Term Definition Example Process Function What the process step is supposed to do ‘Drill hole to 10mm ± 0.1mm’ Failure Mode How the process can fail to perform its function Hole diameter undersize, oversize, off-location Failure Effect The consequence of the failure on the customer or next operation Part rejected at assembly, field failure Severity (S) Rating (1-10) of how serious the failure effect is 10 = safety hazard, 1 = no effect Failure Cause Why the failure mode might occur Drill bit wear, incorrect feed rate Occurrence (O) Rating (1-10) of how likely the cause is to happen 10 = very high, 1 = remote Current Controls What currently prevents the cause or detects the failure In-process gauge, SPC chart Detection (D) Rating (1-10) of how likely current controls will detect the failure 10 = no detection, 1 = certain detection RPN Risk Priority Number = S × O × D Range: 1 to 1000 Action Priority (AP) Alternative prioritization method (AIAG-VDA) High, Medium, Low 8.3.4 The PFMEA Form The PFMEA is documented in a structured form. Here is a simplified template: Table 8.5: PFMEA Form Template (Simplified) Process Step Function Failure Mode Effect S Cause O Current Controls D RPN Action Example: Drill hole Hole undersize Assembly interference 7 Drill wear 5 Visual inspection 6 210 Add in-process gauge 8.4 The PFMEA Methodology: 10 Steps PFMEA follows a systematic 10-step methodology. Each step builds on the previous one. Figure 8.5: The 10-Step PFMEA Methodology 8.4.1 Step 1: Define Scope and Process Boundaries Before starting the analysis, clearly define what is included and excluded. Table 8.6: Step 1: Defining PFMEA Scope Element Description Example: Injection Molding Process Name Clear name identifying the process Plastic Part Injection Molding Start Boundary Where does our analysis begin? Raw material loading into hopper End Boundary Where does our analysis end? Part removed from mold, ready for packaging Included Operations All operations within scope Material prep, injection, cooling, ejection, inspection Excluded Operations Operations analyzed separately or by others Mold design (covered by DFMEA), packaging Key Assumptions Conditions assumed to be true Material meets incoming spec, mold is validated 8.4.2 Step 2: Process Mapping and Identifying Functions Create a detailed process flow diagram and identify the function of each step. Figure 8.6: Example: Injection Molding Process Flow 8.4.3 Step 3: Identifying Potential Failure Modes For each process function, ask: “How can this step fail to perform its intended function?” Table 8.7: Step 3: Identifying Failure Modes Process Function Potential Failure Mode Category Load correct material Wrong material loaded Wrong item Load correct material Material contaminated Degraded item Load correct material Insufficient material Missing item Melt to specification temperature Temperature too low Below specification Melt to specification temperature Temperature too high Above specification Fill mold completely Short shot (incomplete fill) Incomplete operation Fill mold completely Flash (overfill) Excessive operation Fill mold completely Air entrapment Unintended result Common failure mode categories: - No operation (step doesn’t happen) - Partial operation (incomplete) - Degraded operation (below standard) - Excessive operation (too much) - Wrong operation (incorrect action) - Intermittent operation (inconsistent) Interactive Exercise: Identify Failure Modes Process Step: Heat treat steel parts at 850°C for 2 hours Function: Achieve required hardness (58-62 HRC) Identify at least 5 potential failure modes: Answers: 1. Temperature too low → Parts soft (below hardness spec) 2. Temperature too high → Parts brittle/cracked 3. Time too short → Incomplete hardening 4. Time too long → Over-hardening, distortion 5. Uneven heating → Inconsistent hardness across part 6. Wrong atmosphere → Surface decarburization 7. Quench delay too long → Soft spots 8.4.4 Step 4: Analyzing Failure Effects For each failure mode, determine: “What is the consequence if this failure occurs?” Consider effects at multiple levels: 1. Local effect: Impact on immediate operation 2. Next operation effect: Impact on downstream process 3. End customer effect: Impact on final user Table 8.8: Step 4: Analyzing Effects at Multiple Levels Failure Mode Effect Level Effect Description Short shot Local Part is incomplete/missing features Short shot Next Operation Part rejected at inspection, line stoppage Short shot End Customer If shipped: product malfunction, safety hazard Flash Local Excess material on part edges Flash Next Operation Secondary trimming required, increased cycle time Flash End Customer If shipped: poor fit, appearance defect 8.4.5 Step 5: Determining Severity Ratings Severity (S) rates the seriousness of the effect on a scale of 1-10. Table 8.9: Severity Rating Scale (S) Rating Effect Criteria Example 10 Hazardous - without warning Safety hazard; noncompliance with regulations; no warning Brake failure without warning 9 Hazardous - with warning Safety hazard; noncompliance with regulations; with warning Airbag warning light before failure 8 Very High Product inoperable; loss of primary function Engine won’t start 7 High Product operable but at reduced performance Engine runs rough, reduced power 6 Moderate Product operable; comfort/convenience affected; noticeable Wind noise, A/C takes longer to cool 5 Low Product operable; reduced comfort; noticed by average customer Door handle feels loose 4 Very Low Product operable; slightly reduced comfort; noticed by discriminating customer Slight paint imperfection 3 Minor Fit/finish nonconforming; noticed by discriminating customer Panel gap slightly uneven 2 Very Minor Fit/finish nonconforming; noticed only by trained observer Under-hood label crooked 1 None No discernible effect No effect observable Important: Severity is determined by the effect, not the failure mode. Severity can only be reduced by changing the design — process changes typically cannot reduce severity. 8.4.6 Step 6: Identifying Potential Causes For each failure mode, identify all possible causes: “Why might this failure occur?” Figure 8.7: Fishbone Diagram: Causes of Short Shot 8.4.7 Step 7: Rating Occurrence Occurrence (O) rates the likelihood that the cause will occur on a scale of 1-10. Table 8.10: Occurrence Rating Scale (O) Rating Likelihood Criteria Approximate Rate Cpk Equivalent 10 Very High Failure is almost inevitable ≥100 per 1000 (≥10%) &lt; 0.33 9 Very High Failures occur very frequently 50 per 1000 (5%) ≥ 0.33 8 High Failures occur frequently 20 per 1000 (2%) ≥ 0.51 7 High Failures occur on regular basis 10 per 1000 (1%) ≥ 0.67 6 Moderate Occasional failures 5 per 1000 (0.5%) ≥ 0.83 5 Moderate Occasional failures expected 2 per 1000 (0.2%) ≥ 1.00 4 Low Relatively few failures 1 per 1000 (0.1%) ≥ 1.17 3 Low Few failures 0.5 per 1000 (500 ppm) ≥ 1.33 2 Remote Failure unlikely 0.1 per 1000 (100 ppm) ≥ 1.50 1 Remote Failure nearly impossible ≤0.01 per 1000 (≤10 ppm) ≥ 1.67 8.4.8 Step 8: Current Controls and Detection Ratings Identify current controls and rate their ability to detect the failure or cause. Types of Process Controls: Table 8.11: Types of Process Controls Control Type Purpose Examples Impact on PFMEA Prevention Controls Prevent the cause from occurring Error-proofing (poka-yoke), interlocks, maintenance programs Reduces Occurrence rating Detection Controls Detect the failure mode or cause after it occurs Inspection, testing, gauging, SPC monitoring Reduces Detection rating Detection Rating Scale: Table 8.12: Detection Rating Scale (D) Rating Detection Criteria Example Control 10 Absolute Uncertainty No current control; cannot detect or is not analyzed No inspection planned 9 Very Remote Control will probably not detect Indirect measurement only 8 Remote Control has poor chance of detection Visual inspection of hidden feature 7 Very Low Control has low chance of detection Manual 100% visual inspection 6 Low Control may detect Variable gauging after operation 5 Moderate Control has moderate chance of detection SPC charting 4 Moderately High Control has moderately high chance of detection In-station gauging with feedback 3 High Control has high chance of detection Automated 100% gauging 2 Very High Control almost certain to detect Multiple independent automated checks 1 Almost Certain Control will detect; error-proofed Error-proofing prevents defect creation Important: Detection ratings are often harder to reduce than occurrence ratings. Adding inspection doesn’t prevent defects — it only catches them. Prevention is always better than detection. Question: Why are detection ratings often harder to improve? Detection ratings are harder to reduce because: Detection doesn’t prevent: The defect has already been made; you’re just trying to find it Human inspection is unreliable: Typical effectiveness is only 80-85% for visual inspection 100% inspection is expensive: Automated inspection requires significant investment Some defects are hard to detect: Internal defects, intermittent problems, latent failures Sampling has limitations: Even good sampling plans miss some defects Better approach: Focus on reducing occurrence through: - Error-proofing (poka-yoke) - Process capability improvement - Preventive maintenance - Better training 8.4.9 Step 9: Calculating RPN and Prioritization The Risk Priority Number (RPN) combines all three ratings: \\[\\text{RPN} = \\text{Severity (S)} \\times \\text{Occurrence (O)} \\times \\text{Detection (D)}\\] # Example RPN Calculations # Failure Mode 1: Short shot S1 &lt;- 7 # Severity: Product inoperable (assembly) O1 &lt;- 5 # Occurrence: Occasional D1 &lt;- 6 # Detection: Moderate (visual inspection) RPN1 &lt;- S1 * O1 * D1 cat(&quot;Short shot RPN:&quot;, RPN1, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Short shot RPN: 210 # Failure Mode 2: Flash S2 &lt;- 4 # Severity: Appearance issue O2 &lt;- 6 # Occurrence: Regular D2 &lt;- 3 # Detection: High (easy to see) RPN2 &lt;- S2 * O2 * D2 cat(&quot;Flash RPN:&quot;, RPN2, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Flash RPN: 72 # Failure Mode 3: Contamination S3 &lt;- 9 # Severity: Safety concern (medical device) O3 &lt;- 3 # Occurrence: Low D3 &lt;- 7 # Detection: Low (internal contamination) RPN3 &lt;- S3 * O3 * D3 cat(&quot;Contamination RPN:&quot;, RPN3, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Contamination RPN: 189 # Comparison cat(&quot;\\n--- Priority Order by RPN ---\\n&quot;) ## ## --- Priority Order by RPN --- cat(&quot;1.

B: Surface scratch 3 7 2 ? C: Missing component 8 2 8 ? D: Wrong material 9 3 6 ? Answers: - A: 6 × 4 × 5 = 120 - B: 3 × 7 × 2 = 42 - C: 8 × 2 × 8 = 128 - D: 9 × 3 × 6 = 162 Priority Order: D (162) &gt; C (128) &gt; A (120) &gt; B (42) Question: Should we always address the highest RPN first? See limitations discussion below. 8.4.10 Limitations of RPN RPN has known limitations that must be understood: Figure 8.8: RPN Limitation Example Key RPN Limitations: Same RPN, different risk: 10×1×4 = 40, but 2×10×2 = 40 Severity often overlooked: High severity should always trigger action Arbitrary thresholds: Why is 100 the magic number? Non-linear scale: Difference between 2 and 3 is not same as 8 and 9 8.4.11 Action Priority (AP) Method — AIAG-VDA Alternative The 2019 AIAG-VDA FMEA Handbook introduced the Action Priority (AP) method as an alternative to RPN. Table 8.14: Action Priority (AP) Method Priority Criteria Action Required HIGH Severity = 9 or 10 (any O, any D) Must take action to improve prevention/detection HIGH Severity = 8 AND Occurrence ≥ 4 Must take action MEDIUM Severity = 7 AND Occurrence ≥ 5 Should take action MEDIUM Severity = 5-6 AND Occurrence ≥ 6 AND Detection ≥ 5 Should take action LOW All other combinations May take action; document rationale if no action 8.4.12 Step 10: Recommended Actions and Follow-Up For high-priority items, develop specific recommended actions.

Figure 8.10: PFMEA Integration with Quality Tools 8.7.1 From PFMEA to Control Plan The PFMEA directly feeds the Control Plan — a document that specifies what controls are needed at each process step. Table 8.20: PFMEA to Control Plan Linkage From PFMEA To Control Plan Process Step Operation/Step Failure Mode Characteristic to Control Severity Classification (Critical/Significant) Cause Process Parameter Current Control Control Method Detection Reaction Plan 8.8 Common Pitfalls and Best Practices 8.8.1 Common Pitfalls to Avoid Table 8.21: Common PFMEA Pitfalls and Solutions Pitfall Problem Solution Paperwork Exercise PFMEA done only to satisfy customer requirement Conduct meaningful analysis with intent to improve One-Person Show Engineer completes alone without team input Require cross-functional team participation Optimistic Detection Overestimating effectiveness of current controls Validate detection effectiveness with data Static Document Never updated after process changes Review and update after any process change RPN Obsession Focusing only on RPN numbers, missing high-severity items Also consider severity alone; use AP method Vague Failure Modes Failure modes too general to be actionable Be specific: ‘hole undersize’ not ‘bad hole’ 8.8.2 Best Practices Table 8.22: PFMEA Best Practices Practice Description Start Early Begin PFMEA during process design, not after problems occur Include Operators Operators know failures that never get documented Use Historical Data Use warranty data, scrap reports, customer complaints Be Specific Specific failure modes lead to specific actions Follow Up Verify that actions were implemented and effective Living Document Review and update regularly (minimum annually) 8.9 Case Study: Preventing a Major Quality Issue 8.9.1 Background Company: Automotive brake component manufacturer Product: Brake caliper mounting bracket Situation: New manufacturing process being implemented for a high-volume contract 8.9.2 PFMEA Analysis During the PFMEA session, the team identified a critical failure mode: Table 8.23: Case Study: Critical Failure Mode Identified Element Analysis Process Step Drill mounting holes Function Create holes at 45.0 ±0.1mm spacing Failure Mode Hole spacing out of tolerance Effect Caliper misalignment, brake performance affected Severity 9 (safety-related) Cause Fixture wear, thermal expansion Occurrence 4 (occasional) Current Control CMM check 5 per shift Detection 5 (moderate sampling) RPN 180 8.9.3 Actions Taken Based on the PFMEA, the team implemented: In-process gauging: Automated measurement after every part (D: 5 → 2) Fixture monitoring: Temperature compensation and wear tracking (O: 4 → 2) Enhanced fixture design: Carbide wear surfaces (O: 4 → 2) # Before improvements S_before &lt;- 9 O_before &lt;- 4 D_before &lt;- 5 RPN_before &lt;- S_before * O_before * D_before cat(&quot;Before RPN:&quot;, RPN_before, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Before RPN: 180 # After improvements S_after &lt;- 9 # Severity unchanged (inherent) O_after &lt;- 2 # Reduced through fixture improvements D_after &lt;- 2 # Reduced through 100% gauging RPN_after &lt;- S_after * O_after * D_after cat(&quot;After RPN:&quot;, RPN_after, &quot;\\n&quot;) ## After RPN: 36 cat(&quot;Reduction:&quot;, round((1 - RPN_after/RPN_before)*100), &quot;%\\n&quot;) ## Reduction: 80 % 8.9.4 Results Zero field failures related to hole spacing after 18 months of production Estimated avoided cost: $2.4 million in potential recall and warranty Investment: $85,000 for gauging and fixture upgrades ROI: 28:1 Key Lesson: The PFMEA investment of $85,000 prevented a potential $2.4 million problem. This is the power of proactive risk management. 8.10 Summary Table 8.24: PFMEA Key Concepts Summary Topic Key Points PFMEA Purpose Prevent defects before they occur; proactive vs. reactive quality Key Ratings Severity (effect), Occurrence (likelihood), Detection (control effectiveness) RPN Calculation RPN = S × O × D; Range 1-1000; Higher = More risk Prioritization Address high RPN first, but always act on high severity (9-10) Action Priority AIAG-VDA method: High/Medium/Low based on S-O-D combination Best Practice Cross-functional team, living document, follow-up on actions 8.11 Review Questions 8.11.1 Conceptual Questions Question 1: What is the difference between a failure mode and a failure effect? Failure Mode: How the process fails to perform its intended function - Example: “Hole drilled undersize” - Example: “Temperature too low” - Example: “Missing component” Failure Effect: The consequence of the failure mode - Example: “Part rejected at assembly” (effect of undersize hole) - Example: “Product not properly cured” (effect of low temperature) - Example: “Product doesn’t function” (effect of missing component) Key Relationship: One failure mode can have multiple effects at different levels (local, downstream, customer). Question 2: Why should PFMEA be conducted by a cross-functional team? Reasons for Cross-Functional Team: Diverse expertise: No single person understands all aspects Multiple perspectives: Quality sees defects differently than production Historical knowledge: Operators know undocumented problems Buy-in: People support what they help create System thinking: Process interactions become visible Better solutions: Different functions propose different improvements Typical team composition: - Process Engineer (owner) - Quality Engineer - Production Supervisor/Operator - Maintenance Technician - Design Engineer - Supplier Representative (when applicable) Question 3: Explain why detection ratings are often harder to reduce than occurrence ratings. Detection is harder to reduce because: Detection doesn’t prevent: Defect already exists; just trying to find it Human inspection is unreliable: 80-85% effectiveness typical 100% inspection is expensive: Requires automation investment Some defects are hidden: Internal defects, intermittent failures Sampling limitations: Cannot catch all defects with sampling Better approach: Focus on occurrence reduction: - Error-proofing (poka-yoke) - Process capability improvement - Preventive maintenance - Better training Example: Reducing drill wear (occurrence) is more effective than adding more inspection (detection). Question 4: At what point in process development should PFMEA ideally be conducted? Ideal Timing: During process design, before production begins Why early is better: - Changes cost 1x during design - Changes cost 10x during production - Changes cost 100x after customer delivery PFMEA Timing Points: 1. New process development: Before equipment is ordered 2. New product introduction: During process planning 3. Process changes: Before implementing changes 4. Quality issues: When problems indicate process risk 5. Regular review: Annually at minimum Key Principle: The earlier PFMEA is conducted, the more opportunity exists to design out failures rather than inspect them out. 8.11.2 Calculation Questions Question 5: Given S=8, O=6, D=4, calculate RPN. If improved controls reduce detection to 2, what is the new RPN? Initial Calculation: RPN = S × O × D RPN = 8 × 6 × 4 = 192 After Detection Improvement: New RPN = 8 × 6 × 2 = 96 Analysis: - Original RPN: 192 (Significant risk, action required) - New RPN: 96 (Moderate risk) - Reduction: 50% Note: Severity (8) remains unchanged because it’s determined by the effect, not by process controls. Only occurrence and detection can be reduced through process improvements. Question 6: Two failure modes have RPNs of 120 and 150. Should the higher RPN always be addressed first? Answer: Not necessarily! Consider the following scenarios: Scenario A: - Failure Mode 1: RPN = 150 (S=3, O=10, D=5) — Minor cosmetic issue - Failure Mode 2: RPN = 120 (S=10, O=3, D=4) — Safety hazard Priority: Address Failure Mode 2 first despite lower RPN because: - Severity 10 indicates safety hazard - High-severity items should always be addressed regardless of RPN - The AP (Action Priority) method would classify this as HIGH priority When to prioritize lower RPN: - Higher severity (especially 9-10) - Regulatory or safety implications - Customer-critical characteristic - Easier/faster to implement Key Lesson: RPN is a prioritization tool, not the only decision criterion. Use engineering judgment. 8.11.3 Application Questions Question 7: For a metal stamping operation, identify at least five potential failure modes and their likely effects. Metal Stamping PFMEA: # Failure Mode Effect 1 Part not fully formed Dimensional rejection, functional failure 2 Burrs on edges Injury hazard, assembly interference 3 Cracks/splits Structural failure, scrap 4 Wrong material thickness Dimensional/strength issues 5 Mislocated features Assembly issues, rejection 6 Surface scratches Appearance rejection, corrosion initiation 7 Springback out of tolerance Dimensional rejection 8 Die mark/impression Appearance defect Potential Causes for “Part not fully formed”: - Insufficient press tonnage - Die wear - Material too hard - Lubrication insufficient - Press speed too fast Question 8: A process has RPN of 240 (S=8, O=6, D=5). Propose three improvement strategies and calculate resulting RPN. Current State: S=8, O=6, D=5, RPN=240 Strategy 1: Improve Detection - Add automated inspection (100% gauging) - New D = 2 - New RPN = 8 × 6 × 2 = 96 (60% reduction) Strategy 2: Improve Occurrence - Add error-proofing (poka-yoke) to prevent cause - New O = 2 - New RPN = 8 × 2 × 5 = 80 (67% reduction) Strategy 3: Combined Approach - Error-proofing (O → 3) + Better detection (D → 3) - New RPN = 8 × 3 × 3 = 72 (70% reduction) Recommendation: Strategy 2 (error-proofing) is typically preferred because: - Prevents defects from occurring - More sustainable long-term - Reduces inspection costs - Better for customer confidence 8.11.4 Critical Thinking Questions Question 9: Discuss the limitations of using RPN as the sole prioritization method. RPN Limitations: Equal weighting problem: 10×1×4 = 40 (safety hazard, rare) 2×10×2 = 40 (minor, frequent) Same RPN, very different risk! Severity often overlooked: High-severity items (9-10) should always be addressed RPN can hide safety-critical issues Non-linear scales: Difference between S=2 and S=3 is not same as S=8 and S=9 Multiplication assumes linear relationship Arbitrary thresholds: Why is RPN=100 the “action” threshold? No scientific basis for specific cutoffs Gaming the system: Teams may manipulate ratings to avoid action Subjectivity in ratings Better Approaches: - Action Priority (AP) method - Always act on S ≥ 9 regardless of RPN - Consider multiple criteria (cost, feasibility, timing) - Use risk matrix visualization Question 10: How would you handle a situation where team members disagree on severity ratings? Approach to Rating Disagreements: 1. Clarify the failure effect: - Ensure everyone understands the same effect - Be specific about which customer sees which impact 2. Reference the rating criteria: - Use the standardized scale consistently - Point to specific criteria, not opinions 3. Consider worst-case scenario: - PFMEA should consider worst reasonable case - “Could this effect happen?” vs “Will it happen?” 4. Gather data: - Review historical data if available - What have similar failures caused in the past? 5. When in doubt, go higher: - Conservative approach is appropriate for safety - Can always reduce later with evidence 6. Document the discussion: - Record the rationale for the rating - Note if there was disagreement and why decision was made 7. Get external input: - Bring in customer perspective if needed - Consult subject matter experts Final Rule: If a safety or regulatory issue is possible, severity should be 9 or 10 regardless of probability. 8.12 References AIAG &amp; VDA.
