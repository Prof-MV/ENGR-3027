# Introduction {-}

Why are we studying this?

  *	Defining and identifying manufacturing processes is critical to understanding the role that automation plays and how to program an industrial process line.
  * What are some examples of a manufacturing process?
  *	What do we have or use that is manufactured?
  *	What is the biggest manufacturing change that you have experienced so far?

  *	Processes have changed throughout the centuries and have been driven by the four Industrial Revolutions.
  
  *	First Industrial Revolution – Coal in 1765
    * This transformed society from an agricultural base to an industrial base. Processes became mechanized and rather than hand made, products were manufactured. The discovery of coal and the development of the steam engine and metal forging transformed the way goods were created.
    
  * Second Industrial Revolution – Gas in 1870
    *The discovery of oil and electricity fueled the second industrial revolution. The discovery of oil lead to the invention of the combustion engine and new steel and chemical based products entered the manufacturing streams. Technological advances in communication were driven by the invention of the telegraph and later the telephone. Modes of transportation developed with the invention of the airplane and automobile. These discoveries helped to drive the advent of mass production which forever changed how items were produced.
    
  * Third Industrial Revolution – Electronics and Nuclear Energy in 1969
    *The third industrial revolution is dominated by the development of electronics and the beginning of the age of computers.
    *Technological developments were centered around four pillars of science: telecommunications, biotechnology, information technology and energy engineering.
    
  *	Fourth Industrial Revolution – Internet and AI
    * The fourth industrial revolution describes the current era of digitalization, automation, and advanced manufacturing technology. It's characterized by the convergence of emerging technologies, such as robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 3D printing.

# Types of Manufacturing Processes [@AfzalManufacturing]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing is defined as the conversion of raw materials into the finished goods on a large scale using man and machine whereas manufacturing processes are defined as the methods used for conversion of raw materials into finished products. Based on the product requirement there different types of manufacturing processes which are used to get the required output.

In this chapter, you are going to learn about the seven types manufacturing processes and their subtypes with examples.

Some websites mention four types of manufacturing processes while some mention five types of manufacturing processes. Although, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_manufacturing_processes) lists 7 main types of manufacturing processes which we are going to discuss below.

## Casting

Casting is a process of pouring liquid metal into a mold containing the hollow shape of the desired outcome. It uses sprue, gates, and runners to pour the metal. The main types of manufacturing processes under casting are:-

### Centrifugal Casting

Centrifugal casting is a process of pouring molten metal into a spinning die. Spinning die creates high g-forces to the molten metal which gives it the cylindrical shape. Moreover, spinning let the impurities (less dense material) to float at the inner dia from where it is removed later. Spinning can either be on a vertical or horizontal axis depending on the configuration of the desired part such as vertical rotation is used to cast ring and cylinder and horizontal rotation is used to cast tubular shapes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Centrifugal Casting"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957143378.png")

```

Example: Some examples of centrifugal casting include jet engine compressor cases, petrochemical furnace tubes, military products, and other high-reliability applications.

### Die Casting

Die casting is a manufacturing process used for producing metal parts where high precision is required. This process is accomplished by forcing molten metal under high pressure into reusable metal dies. High volume production is done using this process.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Die Casting"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957168838.gif")

```

Process

Steel molds capable of producing several castings at once are produced. Molds are mounted securely in a die casting machine and are arranged so that one is stationary while the other is moveable. The die cavity is injected with molten metal and allowed to solidify and the part is ejected. Example: Die casting process is used for producing precise non-ferrous metal parts. Some examples of die casting include engines, clutch housings, and covers of a four-wheeled vehicle.

### Sand Casting

Sand casting is a metal casting process that uses sand as the mold material. This process has a low production rate as the sand mold must be destroyed in order to remove the part. Although, it is a cheap process when low volume production is required.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Sand Casting"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957188942.png")

```

Sand Casting Process: \* Materials used include the furnace, metal, pattern, and sand mold. \* The molten metal is poured using a ladle into the cavity of the sand mold, which is created using the pattern. \* The casting is allowed to solidify and then removed by breaking the sand mold.

Example: More than 70% of all metal castings are produced via sand casting process. Some examples of sand casting process include engine blocks, machine tool bases, cylinder heads, pump housings, valves, gears, pulleys, crankshafts, connecting rods, and propellers.

### Permanent Mold Casting

Permanent mold casting is a manufacturing process that offers reusability of metal molds which makes it eligible for high volume production. This process uses gravity or vacuum or gas to fill the mold.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Permanent Mold Casting"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957226624.jpg")

```

Process

The mold is preheated and a ceramic coating is applied to the mold cavity surfaces to facilitate part removal. The molten metal is poured from a ladle and gravity or vacuum is used to raise the molten metal into the mold assembly. The casting is allowed to solidify and then removed by opening the mold assembly. Example: Some examples of permanent mold casting include gears, pipe fittings, fuel injection housings, splines, wheels, gear housings, engine pistons.

Note the difference: Sand casting uses an expendable mold which is destroyed after each cycle whereas permanent mold casting and die casting uses a metal mold that is reused for several thousand times. Permanent mold casting process is considerably slower, and not as precise as die casting. Also, an external force is used to inject molten metal in die casting as compared to gravity or vacuum in permanent mold casting.

### Investment Casting

Investment casting is metal casting process of pouring molten metal into an expendable ceramic mold. This process is also known as “lost-wax casting” as the wax pattern is melted out of the mold when molten metal is poured. Complex parts are made using this process.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Investment Casting"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957292681.jpg")

```

Process

The wax pattern is prepared and surrounded/invested by the ceramic slurry that hardens it and converts it into a mold. The mold is preheated to evaporate the wax and the molten metal is poured from a ladle into the mold. The casting is allowed to solidify and then the mold is broken and the casting removed. Example: Some examples of investment casting include turbine blades, airplane parts, firearm components and military equipment.

```

### Shell Molding

Shell molding is a metal casting process that uses a sand covered with resin to form the mold. This process is similar to sand casting process but has better dimensional accuracy, higher productivity rate, and lower labor requirements. Also, the Shell Molds are reusable and expandable.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Shell Molding"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957333118.jpg")

```

Process

A two-piece metal pattern is created in the shape of the desired part using iron or steel. These patterns are clamped to a dump box containing the mixture of sand and a resin binder. This is known as shell preparation method. These shells are joined together and clamped to form the complete shell mold and the molten metal is poured from a ladle into the mold cavity. After the casting is solidified, the mold is broken and the casting removed. Example: Shell molding is used for producing high precision parts. Some examples of shell molding include gear housings, cylinder heads, connecting rods, and lever arms.

## Molding

Molding is a manufacturing process that uses a rigid frame to shape hot liquid or a ductile raw material. It is mostly used to manufacture plastic products. The different types of manufacturing processes under molding are:

### Injection Molding

Injection molding is a molding process used for producing parts by injecting molten material into a mold. It is the most commonly used molding process for manufacturing plastic parts. This process requires the use of an injection molding machine, raw plastic pellets, and a mold to get the desired output. The plastic is melted in the injection molding machine with the help of heaters and then a rotating/reciprocating screw injects it into the mold, where it cools and solidifies into the final part.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Injection Molding"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957354507.png")

```

Example: Some examples of injection molding include automotive parts and components, game toys, chairs, tables, storage containers, housing for household appliances, consumer electronics, buckets.

### Blow Molding

Blow molding is a molding process used to manufacture hollow plastic parts. This process starts with melting down the plastic and forming it into a parison. The parison is then clamped into a mold and air is blown into it. This air pushes the plastic out to match the mold. The plastic is allowed to cool and later the mold opened and the part is ejected. Although the blow molding process is costlier than injection molding, it is still used for manufacturing many plastic products.

Blow molding is divided into three types of manufacturing processes namely extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, and injection stretch blow molding.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Blow Molding"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957373575.jpg")

```

Example: Some examples of blow molding include automotive ducts, stadium seating chairs, containers, trays, reservoirs, tanks, coolers, fan housings, panels, doors, toys, sporting goods, watering cans and household products, carrying cases.

### Extrusion Molding

Extrusion Molding is a process used to manufacture long tube-shaped products of a fixed cross-section. This process uses an extrusion machine to force the heated plastic through a die with an opening. The machine uses a reciprocating/rotating screw to feed the plastic into the die. The die then forces the material into the desired shape or the shape of the die. Heaters are used to melting the plastic in the extrusion machine. The material is allowed to cooled and then cut down into the required shape.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Extrusion Molding"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957392232.gif")

```

Example: Some examples of extrusion molding include pipe, tube, plastic films and sheeting, thermoplastic coatings, and wire insulation.

### Rotational Molding

Rotational Molding is a molding process used for manufacturing hollow parts. This process is accomplished by placing resin into a hollow mold and then rotating that tool bi-axially in an oven. There is no pressure involved in this technique, unlike other plastic manufacturing processes. Thus, making the mold cost cheap and the process economical.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Rotational Molding"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957410843.jpg")

```

Process

The mold is filled with a polymer resin and heated in an oven until the resin melts inside of the mold cavity. It is then slowly rotated to disperse and stick the soft material inside the mold cavity. A cool tool is used to solidify the part and later the part is removed from the mold. Example: Some examples of rotational molding include water tanks, medical products, consumer’s products, toys, leisure craft, sporting equipment.

### Thermoforming

Thermoforming is a molding process where a plastic sheet is heated to an elastic forming temperature and formed into the desired shape. This method is often used for sample and prototype parts. It is divided into three types of manufacturing processes namely vacuum forming, pressure forming and mechanical forming.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Thermoforming"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957440479.gif")

```

Process

The thermoplastic sheet is heated using either convection or radiation until it gets soften. This soft sheet is then pressed against the mold using the vacuum or air pressure or mechanical force. The excess material is then trimmed away and the formed part is released. Example: Some examples of thermoforming include switchgear, motor components, thrust washers, ash cups, valve covers, disc brake pistons, knobs, and handles.

### Powder Metallurgy

Powder metallurgy is a molding process used for manufacturing precision metal components from metal powders. The rate of production of parts is quite high in powder metallurgy which makes it economical than the other casting processes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Powder Metallurgy"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957542388.png")

```

Process

A homogeneous mixture of metal powders or alloy powders is prepared. The metal powder is then pressed into the desired shape at room temperature. At last, the product is heated that causes the powder particles to fuse together without melting. Example: Some examples of powder metallurgy include self -lubricating bearings, porous metal filters, gears, cams, brackets, sprockets.

## Forming

Forming is a manufacturing process that uses suitable stresses such as compression, tension or shear to deform the material and get the desired shape. This process involves deformation and displacement of material leading to no material removal or loss of material. The different types of manufacturing processes under forming are:

### Forging

Forging is a manufacturing process that uses compressive forces to shape the material. This process is accomplished with the help of a hammer, press or a special forging machine. The forged parts have good strength and toughness without the defects of porosity, inclusion or voids, also they can be used reliably for highly stressed and critical applications.

Forging may be carried out on materials in either hot or cold state and therefore, it is divided into types of manufacturing processes i.e. cold forging and hot forging.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Forging"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957560571.jpg")
```

Example: Some examples of forging include hammers, sleds, wrenches, garden tools, sockets, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, jewelry, rivets, bolts.

### Bending

Bending is a manufacturing process used to deform metal into the desired shape by using a die and punch. This process is most commonly used for sheet metal products to get the required U-shape, V-shape or the channel shape. Commonly used bending machines are pan brakes, brake presses, and other specialized machine presses.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Bending"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957570680.png")
```

Process

The material is placed on the die and positioned in place with the help of stops. The upper part of the press with appropriately shaped punch attached to it descends and forms the V-shaped bend. The U-punch forms the U-shape with a single punch. Example: Some examples of bending operations include electric enclosures, electrical boxes, brackets, rectangular ductwork.

### Stamping

Stamping or pressing is a manufacturing process in which thin walled metal parts are shaped desirably with the help of punches and dies. This process is accomplished by placing flat sheet metal into a stamping press where a tool and die surface forms the metal into the desired shape. Stamping uses hydraulic or mechanical press to perform the operations which can be done at a single die station or multiple die stations. Also, this process is usually carried out on sheet metal, but can also be used on other materials, such as polystyrene.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Stamping"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957586363.jpg")
```

Example: Some examples of stamping include trunks, doors, panels, enclosures, fenders, roof, and hood outer parts.

### Shearing

Shearing is a manufacturing process used to remove a blank of required shape and dimension from a large sheet of metal, paper or plastics. This process includes cutting of sheet without the formation of chips or the use of burning or melting. Shearing is divided into following types of manufacturing processes:

-   Blanking
-   Piercing
-   Roll slitting
-   Trimming
-   Coining

Process

-   The punch applies pressure to the sheet forming cracks on both the top and bottom edges of the sheet.
-   The punch goes down further to grow these cracks and eventually separate the slug from the material. Example

Some examples of shearing include industrial machinery, automobile parts, electronic equipment, knives, scissors.

## Machining

Machining is a manufacturing process used to cut a piece of raw material into the desired shape and size with the help of controlled material-removal process. These processes are based on a common theme known as subtractive manufacturing. The machining process is used for all the types of product especially metal products. The different types of manufacturing processes under machining are:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Machining"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957720530.jpg")
```

1.  Milling is a process of removal of material from a workpiece using rotary cutters and getting the desired shape.
2.  Turning is a process of removal of unwanted material from circular parts using a cutting tool. This process requires a lathe, workpiece, fixture, and a cutting tool.
3.  Shaping process uses a cutting tool that reciprocates against a stationary workpiece producing a plane or a desired surface.
4.  Drilling process uses a drill bit to make a hole of circular cross-section into the solid material.
5.  Honing process produces a precision surface on a metal workpiece by scrubbing an abrasive stone against it.
6.  Finishing process is used to improve appearance, adhesion, wettability, wear resistance, hardness or to remove burrs and other surface flaws with the help of sanders.

## Joining

Joining or assembling process are part of every production processes where two or more parts are combined together to get the required product. The main types of manufacturing processes under joining are:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Joining"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957735284.jpg")
```

1.  Welding process is used to heat and melt two or more parts and force them together making a single functional part. Arc welding, resistance welding, oxyfuel gas welding are few types of welding operations.
2.  Soldering process is also used to join two or more metal items by melting and putting a filler metal (solder) into the joint. It differs from welding as it does not involve melting of the workpieces.
3.  Brazing process is used to join two or more metal items together by melting and flowing a filler metal into the joint. Brazing uses higher temperatures for a similar process as compared to soldering. Also, it requires much more closely fitted parts than in soldering.
4.  Adhesive bonding is used to hold multiple closely spaced parts together using a filler material called an adhesive. It is mainly used for a non-metallic substance such as a polymer.
5.  Mechanical Assembly – It is a fastening process which uses nut, bolts, and rivets to join the parts together. It is also a reversible joining process.

## Coating or Plating

This process is defined as a method of covering the part surface with powder or zinc or other chemicals to protect it from corrosion, wear and other defects. It is also done to improve the electrical conductivity or magnetic response of the material. The main types of manufacturing processes under the coating process are powder coating, electroplating, sputter deposition.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Coating or Plating"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957756629.jpg")
```

## Additive Manufacturing

Additive manufacturing is the process reversible to subtractive manufacturing i.e. machining. It is a manufacturing process that builds 3D objects by adding layer-upon-layer of material, whether the material is plastic, metal or concrete. Additive manufacturing comprises many technologies such as 3D printing, rapid prototyping, direct digital manufacturing, layered manufacturing and additive fabrication. This technology is growing at a very fast speed due to its high-efficiency and accuracy.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Additive Manufacturing"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1525957777852.png")
```

Example: Some examples of 3D printing include jewelry, toys, decorative items, phone cases.

</details>

## Types of automation in various manufacturing processes

-   Fixed automation – *large volume, single part productions*\
    Fixed automation is a system in which the sequence of processing (or assembly) operations is fixed by the equipment configuration. Each of the operations is the sequence is usually simple, involving perhaps a plain linear or rotational motion or an uncomplicated combination of the two; for example, the feeding of a rotating spindle

-   Programmable automation – *associated with batch production*\
    In programmable automation, the production equipment is designed with the capability to change the sequence of operations to accommodate different product configuration. The operation sequence is controlled by a program, which is a set of instructions coded so that they can be read and interpreted by the system. New programs can be prepared and entered into the equipment to produce new products

-   Flexible automation – *Real time, on-demand production*\
    Flexible automation is an extension of programmable automation. A flexible automated system is capable of producing a variety of parts (or products) with virtually no time lost for changeovers from one part style to the next. There is no lost production time while reprogramming the system and altering the physical setup (tooling, fixtures, machine settings). Consequently, the system can produce various combinations and schedules of parts or products instead of requiring that they be made in batches.

knitr::include_graphics("images/ProcessEngineeringFlow.jpg")
```
  
This flowchart provides a detailed, high-level overview of the sequential phases and functional teams involved in a **Process Plant Project**, from the initial detailed design and engineering phase through to final operation. It outlines the inputs, the core engineering disciplines, and the outputs required for construction and start-up.

### ➡️ Project Phases (The Timeline)

The diagram illustrates the overall project life cycle, which progresses linearly from left to right:

| Phase | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Detailed Design & Engineering** | The phase where all specifications, PFDs, P&IDs, and detailed drawings are created by the various engineering disciplines. |
| **Construction** | The phase where the physical plant is built based on the final engineering documents. |
| **Commissioning** | The phase of checking, testing, and verifying all systems and components to ensure they operate according to design specifications. |
| **Start-Up** | The phase where the plant is brought online and begins production. |
| **Operation** | The final, long-term phase of continuous production and maintenance. |

### 📝 Initial Inputs and Design Foundation (Top Section)

The engineering process begins by defining the scope and constraints based on several foundational documents and requirements:

* **Client Specifications:** Specific needs and performance criteria defined by the client.
* **Functional Requirements:** What the plant must be capable of doing.
* **Company Practices:** Internal standards and procedures.
* **Basic Design:** Initial conceptual and front-end engineering design work.
* **Design Codes & Standards:** Industry regulations (e.g., ASME, API, national codes).
* **Business Requirements:** Financial and operational goals for the plant.



### 📑 Core Engineering Deliverables

The initial inputs lead to the creation of core process documents, which form the foundation for all subsequent detailed engineering disciplines:

* **PFDs (Process Flow Diagrams) & H&M Balance (Heat & Mass Balance):** High-level diagrams showing the process path and material/energy flow.

# Integrated Manufacturing Systems

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Material Handling Methods & Systems

There are four common types of production facility layouts, detailing the key **features** that make each layout suitable for specific production needs and the **typical methods and equipment** used within that structure.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the necessary packages
# dplyr is used for the tibble() function and the pipe operator (%>%)
library(dplyr) 
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra) # Essential for advanced styling

# 1. Create a tibble (data frame) with your table content
data <- tibble(
  `Layout Type` = c("Fixed-Position", "Process", "Cellular", "Product"),
  Features = c("Product is large and heavy, low production rates", 
               "Medium and hard product variety, low and medium production rates", 
               "Soft product variety, medium production rates", 
               "No product variety or soft product variety, high production rates"),
  `Typical Methods and Equipment` = c("Cranes, hoists, fork lift trucks", 
                                      "Fork lift trucks, automated guided vehicles, manual loading at workstations", 
                                      "Conveyors, manual handling for loading and moving between stations", 
                                      "Conveyors for product flow, fork lift trucks or automated guided vehicles to deliver parts to stations")
)

# 2. Use kable() and kableExtra to create and style the HTML table
data %>%
  # Start with kable: it converts the data into a table structure.
  # We specify format = "html" for best use of kableExtra features.
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Material Handling Methods by Plant Layout") %>%
  
  # kable_styling: Applies general table settings.
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), 
    # "striped": alternating row colors
    # "hover": row highlights when mouse hovers over it
    # "condensed": makes the table more compact
    full_width = FALSE, # Prevents the table from stretching to 100% of the page width
    position = "center" # Centers the table on the page
  ) %>%
  
  # column_spec: Styles specific columns.
  column_spec(
    column = 1,  # Target the first column ("Layout Type")
    bold = TRUE, # Make the text bold
    width = "10em" # Set a fixed width to prevent wrapping issues
  ) %>%
  
  # row_spec: Styles specific rows.
  # This highlights the "Fixed-Position" row (row 1) in a light grey.
  row_spec(
    row = 1,
    background = "#f2f2f2" 
  )
```

## Fundamentals of a production Line

A **production line** consists of a series of workstations arranged so that the product moves from one station to the next, and at each location a portion of the total work is performed on it.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Production Line"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ProductionLine.jpg")
```

### Methods of Work Transport

### Manual Methods of Work Transport {-}
Manual methods involve passing the work units between stations by hand.

##### Types: {-}
  - Work units moved in batches
  - Work units moved one at a time
  
##### Problems: {-}
  - Starving of stations
  - Blocking of stations
  - No pacing

### Mechanized Methods of Work Transport {-}
Mechanized methods use powered conveyor or other mechanized apparatus to move work units.
Three major types of work transfer systems are used on production lines:
  
  - continuous transfer
  - synchronous transfer
  - asynchronous transfer

##### Categories: {-}
  - Work units attached to conveyor
  - Work units are removable from conveyor

##### Problems {-}
  - Starving of stations
  - Incomplete units

### Continuous Transport {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Continuous Transport"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ContinuousTransport.png")
```
Conveyor moves at constant velocity v~c~

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Synchronous Transport"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SynchronousTransport.png")
```
All work units are moved simultaneously to their respective next workstations with quick, discontinuous motion.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Asynchronous Transport"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/AsynchronousTransport.png")
```
Work units move independently, not simultaneously. A work unit departs a given station when the worker releases it. Small queues of parts can form at each station.


### What is Work Cycle?
##### Manually Operated Machine {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Manually Operated Machine"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ManuallyOperatedMachine.png")
```
Manually operated machines are controlled or supervised by a human worker. The machine provides the power for the operation and the worker provides the control. The entire work cycle is operator controlled.

##### Semi-Automated Machine {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Semi-Automated Machine"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SemiautomatedMachine.png")
```

A semi-automated machine performs a portion of the work cycle under some form of program control, and a worker tends to the machine for the remainder of the cycle. Typical worker tasks include loading and unloading parts.

##### Fully-Automated Machine {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Fully-Automated Machine"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fullyautomatedMachine.png")
```

Machine operates for extended periods (longer than one work cycle) without worker attention.

### Work Transport Between Stations

Two general categories of work transport in multi-station manufacturing systems:

1. Fixed routing
  - Work units always flow through the same sequence of workstations
  - Most production lines exemplify this category
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Fixed Routing"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fixedrouting.png")
```
2. Variable routing
  - Work units are moved through a variety of different station sequences
  - Most job shops exemblify this category
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Variable Routing"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/variablerouting.png")
```


### ⏰ Explaining Manufacturing Process Times

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Timing Definition"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/TimingDefinition.jpg")
```
The flowchart illustrates three crucial time metrics: **Lead Time**, **Throughput Time**, and **Cycle Time**. These metrics are sequential, with the largest time window encompassing the smaller ones.

#### Lead Time

* **Definition:** **Lead Time** is the total time elapsed from the moment a customer **places an order** until they **receive the finished product**. It represents the customer's total wait time.
* **What it includes:** It covers every step, from order receipt through manufacturing, testing, and shipping (Delivery at Customer).
* **Example:** A customer orders a custom-made widget on Monday. If order processing, manufacturing, and shipping take a total of 6 days, the **Total Lead Time = 6 days.**


#### Throughput Time

* **Definition:** **Throughput Time** (or Manufacturing Lead Time) is the time required to convert raw materials into a finished product that is ready for dispatch. It starts when the **Raw Material (RM) is Received** and ends when the product is **Dispatched** from the factory.
* **What it includes:** All activities within the factory walls, including processing (Turning, Drilling, Tapping), movement, inspection, and any queuing/waiting time before dispatch.
* **Example:** If the total time spent from raw material receipt to final dispatch from the factory is 3 days, the **Total Throughput Time = 3 days.**

#### Cycle Time

Cycle Time is typically broken into two related concepts: **Overall Cycle Time** and **Individual Cycle Time**.

##### Overall Cycle Time (As labeled in the diagram)

* **Definition:** The **Overall Cycle Time** refers to the total time spent actively converting the raw material into a final, ready-to-ship product, beginning with the first value-added operation (like Turning) and ending with the last (like Dispatch).
* **What it includes:** The sum of all individual process times plus any immediate in-process wait times (e.g., Cycle Time 1 + Cycle Time 2 + ...).

##### Individual Cycle Time (`Cycle Time 1`, `Cycle Time 2`, etc.)

* **Definition:** This refers to the **time it takes to complete a single specific task** or process step (e.g., Turning, Drilling, Tapping) on a single product unit.
* **Example:** If the individual processing steps take 30 minutes for Turning, 15 minutes for Drilling, and 10 minutes for Tapping, these are the individual cycle times for those specific tasks.

### 🚀 Cycle Time vs. Efficiency in Manufacturing [@Arcera]

Ever wondered how to measure and improve your manufacturing process? Let’s dive into two key metrics that drive efficiency: **Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT)** and **Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE)**!


#### 🔍 Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT)

This metric tells us how long it takes to produce each unit.

##### Formula:
$$
MCT = \frac{\text{Production Time}}{\text{Units Produced}}
$$

Understanding MCT allows us to identify delays and improve production speed. Reducing cycle time leads to quicker delivery and increased customer satisfaction!

##### Calculation Example:

Let's assume a production run takes 480 minutes (8 hours) and produces 60 units.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Define the variables
production_time_minutes <- 480 # Total time the process ran
units_produced <- 60

# Calculate Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT)
MCT <- production_time_minutes / units_produced

# Print the result
cat("Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT):", MCT, "minutes per unit")
```

#### 📈 Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE)

This metric reveals the efficiency of the production process by focusing on the actual "Process Time" (value-added time) within the entire production period.

##### Formula:
$$
\text{MCE} = \left(\frac{\text{Process Time}}{\text{Production Time}}\right) \times 100\%
$$

**Process Time** is the time spent on activities that directly add value to the product. **Production Time** includes process time plus non-value-added time (e.g., inspection, waiting, moving).

Higher MCE means less waste and more value-added time in production. Aiming for a higher MCE drives leaner operations and cost savings.

##### Calculation Example:


```{r echo=FALSE}
# --- Define the range for Production Time (Total Time) ---
# Let's assume the total production time is between 400 and 600 minutes
min_production <- 400
max_production <- 600

# Generate a random total production time
production_time_minutes <- runif(1, min = min_production, max = max_production)

# --- Define the range for Process Time (Value-Added Work) ---
# The process time must be less than or equal to the production time.
# Let's assume the value-added work is between 50 and the generated production time.
min_process <- 50
max_process <- production_time_minutes # Upper limit is the randomly generated production time

# Generate a random process time
process_time_minutes <- runif(1, min = min_process, max = max_process)

# --- Calculate Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE) ---
MCE <- (process_time_minutes / production_time_minutes) * 100

# --- Print the results ---
cat("Total Production Time (minutes):", round(production_time_minutes, 2), "\n")
cat("Value-Added Process Time (minutes):", round(process_time_minutes, 2), "\n")
cat("--- \n")
cat("Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE):", round(MCE, 2), "%")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="MCT and MCE"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1731060093907.jpg")
```

### Product Variations
In modern manufacturing, systems must handle different levels of product variety. We distinguish between **Hard Product Variety** (significant differences between products) and **Soft Product Variety** (small differences, such as color or minor features). As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:prod-variety-plot2), the complexity of the system increases as we move toward mass customization.

## Manual Assembly Lines
Manual assembly lines consist of multiple workstations where human workers perform repetitive tasks. The efficiency of these lines is governed by the relationship between production rate and cycle time.

### Production Rate and Cycle Time
The production rate ($R_p$) is the number of units produced per hour. The cycle time ($T_c$) is the time interval between units coming off the end of the line.

The mathematical relationship is defined as:
$$T_c = \frac{60}{R_p}$$
where $T_c$ is in minutes and $R_p$ is in units/hour.

### Line Balancing and Repositioning Losses
One of the greatest challenges in manual lines is **Line Balancing**. This involves assigning tasks to workstations so that the total work content time ($T_{wc}$) is distributed evenly. The efficiency of the balance ($E_b$) is calculated as:

$$E_b = \frac{T_{wc}}{n T_c}$$

where $n$ is the number of workstations.

```{r prod-variety-plot2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Relationship between Production Volume and Product Variety.", label= prod-variety-plot2}
library(ggplot2)

# Simulating data for manufacturing system types
df <- data.frame(
  Variety = c("Low", "Medium", "High"),
  Volume = c(1000, 500, 50),
  Type = c("Transfer Line", "FMS", "Job Shop")
)

ggplot(df, aes(x = Variety, y = Volume, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Volume vs. Variety Trade-off",
       x = "Product Variety",
       y = "Annual Production Volume") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```
## Automated Production Lines {#automated-lines}

Automated lines reduce human intervention by using mechanized transfer systems and automated workstations. These systems are typically used for high-volume production where the work content is well-defined.

### Types of Automated Lines
There are two primary configurations for these systems:

* **In-line configuration:** A straight line of workstations where the part moves sequentially from one station to the next.
* **Rotary configuration:** Workstations are arranged around a circular table, often called an indexing table.



### Analysis of Automated Production Lines
The performance of an automated line is often degraded by station failures. If $p$ is the probability of a station failure and $T$ is the average downtime, the actual production rate ($R_p$) is significantly lower than the ideal rate ($R_c$) due to downtime. The actual cycle time ($T_p$) is calculated as:

$$T_p = T_c + pT$$

Where:
* $T_p$ = Average production time per unit.
* $T_c$ = Ideal cycle time.
* $p$ = Probability of station failure.
* $T$ = Average downtime to repair and restart.

### Analysis of Automated Production Lines
The performance of an automated line is rarely ideal; it is degraded by station failures (e.g., tool breakage, jams).

If we define:
* $T_c$: Ideal cycle time (minutes/cycle).
* $p$: Probability of a station failure per cycle.
* $T$: Average downtime per failure (minutes) to repair and restart.

The **Actual Cycle Time ($T_p$)** increases significantly:
$$T_p = T_c + p \times T$$

Consequently, the **Actual Production Rate ($R_p$)** (units per hour) drops below the ideal rate ($R_c = 60/T_c$):
$$R_p = \frac{60}{T_p} = \frac{60}{T_c + pT}$$

To visualize the severe impact of even small failure probabilities on high-speed lines, we can simulate different downtime scenarios. Figure \@ref(fig:downtime-sim) illustrates how quickly production capacity is lost as reliability decreases.

```{r downtime-sim, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Simulation: Impact of Failure Probability (p) and Average Downtime (T) on Hourly Production Rate."}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)

#--- Simulation Parameters ---
Ideal_Tc <- 1.0  # Ideal cycle time is 1 minute per part
Ideal_Rp <- 60 / Ideal_Tc # Ideal rate is 60 units/hour

# 1. Create a range of failure probabilities (p) from 0% to 20%
p_range <- seq(0, 0.20, by = 0.005)

# 2. Define different repair time scenarios (T)
downtime_scenarios <- data.frame(
  Scenario = c("Quick Fix (T=5 min)", "Major Repair (T=30 min)"),
  T_val = c(5, 30)
)

# 3. Generate simulation data grid
sim_data <- expand.grid(p = p_range, Scenario = downtime_scenarios$Scenario) %>%
  left_join(downtime_scenarios, by = "Scenario") %>%
  mutate(
    # Calculate Actual Cycle Time: Tp = Tc + p*T
    Tp = Ideal_Tc + (p * T_val),
    # Calculate Actual Production Rate: Rp = 60 / Tp
    Rp = 60 / Tp
  )

#--- Visualization ---
ggplot(sim_data, aes(x = p, y = Rp, color = Scenario)) +
  # Add the simulation lines
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  # Add a reference line for the Ideal Rate
  geom_hline(yintercept = Ideal_Rp, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey50") +
  annotate("text", x = 0.01, y = Ideal_Rp + 2, label = "Ideal Rate (Zero Failures)", color = "grey50", hjust = 0) +
  # Styling and Labels
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(title = "Production Rate Degradation Analysis",
       subtitle = paste0("Base Ideal Cycle Time (Tc) = ", Ideal_Tc, " min/unit"),
       x = "Probability of Station Failure per Cycle (p)",
       y = "Actual Production Rate (Rp) [units/hour]",
       color = "Downtime Scenario (T)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

As demonstrated in Figure @ref(fig:downtime-sim), even a seemingly low failure probability of 5% ($p=0.05$) can cripple production if the average repair time is long. In the "Major Repair" scenario at 5% failure, production drops from an ideal 60 units/hr to roughly 24 units/hr—a 60% loss in capacity. This highlights why preventive maintenance and rapid repair protocols are critical in automated systems.

## Cellular Manufacturing {#cellular-manufacturing}

Cellular manufacturing applies **Group Technology (GT)** to organize production into cells that specialize in "families" of parts.

### Part Families
A part family is a collection of parts that share similar geometric shapes or manufacturing process steps. By grouping these together, we significantly reduce setup times and simplify tooling requirements.

### Machine Cells
Machine cells are designed to process one or more part families. The arrangement usually follows a **U-shape**, which allows a single operator to move between multiple machines efficiently, facilitating better communication and line balancing.



## Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) and Cells {#fms-section}

An FMS is a highly automated GT cell, consisting of a group of processing stations (usually CNC machines) interconnected by an automated handling system.

### Integrating the FMS Components
Integration is achieved through a central computer system that coordinates:

1.  **Workstation operations:** Sending CNC programs to individual machines.
2.  **Material handling system:** Controlling AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) or conveyors.
3.  **Loading and unloading:** Managing the entry and exit of parts from the system.

### Applications of Flexible Manufacturing Systems
FMS is best suited for mid-volume, mid-variety production where the cost of a fully dedicated transfer line is too high, but the manual job shop is too slow and inefficient.

### Mass Customization
Mass customization is the logic of providing products tailored to individual customer needs at a cost near that of mass-produced items [@groover2016]. As seen in Figure \@ref(fig:prod-variety-plot2), FMS is the primary technological enabler of this strategy.

## Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) {#cim-section}

CIM represents the total integration of all aspects of the manufacturing enterprise through computers. It creates a seamless flow of information from the design phase to the shipping dock.



CIM includes not just the shop floor hardware (FMS, Robots), but also:

* **CAD/CAM:** Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing.
* **ERP:** Enterprise Resource Planning for resource management.
* **CAPP:** Computer-Aided Process Planning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Types of Facility Layouts

There are **four basic layout types**, each suited to different production requirements:

```{r layout-types-table, echo=FALSE}
layout_data <- tibble(
  `Layout Type` = c("Process Layout", "Product Layout", "Hybrid/Cellular Layout", "Fixed-Position Layout"),
  `Also Known As` = c("Functional Layout, Job Shop", "Flow Line, Assembly Line", "Group Technology, Cell Layout", "Project Layout"),

  ) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "12em") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#4472C4", color = "white")
```

### Visualizing the Layout Spectrum

```{r layout-spectrum, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Product Variety vs. Production Volume for Different Layouts", fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
# Create a visualization of layout types based on variety and volume
layout_viz <- data.frame(
  Layout = c("Fixed-Position", "Process", "Cellular", "Product"),
  Volume = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  Variety = c(4, 3.5, 2.5, 1),
  Size = c(15, 20, 20, 25)
)

ggplot(layout_viz, aes(x = Volume, y = Variety, label = Layout)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Size, color = Layout), alpha = 0.7) +

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Process Layout (Functional Layout)

In a **process layout**, similar resources (machines, equipment, workers with similar skills) are grouped together. Work flows between departments based on the specific requirements of each job.

```{r process-layout-diagram, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Example Process Layout - Machine Shop", fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
# Create a simple process layout visualization
library(ggplot2)

departments <- data.frame(
  name = c("Receiving", "Lathes", "Milling", "Drilling", "Grinding", "Assembly", "Painting", "Shipping"),
  x = c(1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6),
  y = c(3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3),
  color = c("#95A5A6", "#3498DB", "#3498DB", "#3498DB", "#3498DB", "#2ECC71", "#9B59B6", "#95A5A6")
)

# Flow paths for different products
flow_A <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 2, 4, 4, 3, 5, 6),
  y = c(3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3),
  product = "Product A"
)

flow_B <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6),
  y = c(3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3),
  product = "Product B"
)

ggplot() +
  # Department boxes

            width = 0.8, height = 0.6, alpha = 0.8, color = "black") +
  geom_text(data = departments, aes(x = x, y = y, label = name),
            fontface = "bold", size = 3.5) +
  # Flow paths
  geom_path(data = flow_A, aes(x = x, y = y + 0.05),
            color = "#E74C3C", size = 1.2, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")),
            linetype = "solid") +
  geom_path(data = flow_B, aes(x = x, y = y - 0.05),
            color = "#F39C12", size = 1.2, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")),
            linetype = "dashed") +

  annotate("text", x = 6.5, y = 3.7, label = "Product B", color = "#F39C12", fontface = "bold") +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1)
```

### Characteristics of Process Layouts

```{r process-characteristics, echo=FALSE}
process_chars <- tibble(
  Characteristic = c("Equipment", "Labor", "Flexibility", "Processing Speed",
                     "Material Handling", "Scheduling", "Space Requirements"),
  Description = c("General-purpose machines", "Skilled workers required",
                  "High - can handle variety", "Slower due to varied routing",
                  "Higher costs (complex paths)", "Complex - different routes",
                  "Higher - WIP inventory storage")
)

  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "10em", background = "#EBF5FB")
```

<details>
<summary>Discussion Question: Can you identify a process layout in your daily life?</summary>

**Think about:**
- A hospital emergency room (patients routed based on their needs)
- A university campus (students move between buildings for different classes)
- A grocery store (customers choose their own path)
- A machine shop (parts routed based on required operations)

**What makes these process layouts?** Similar functions are grouped together, and "products" (patients, students, customers) follow different paths based on their individual needs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Product Layout (Assembly Line)

In a **product layout**, equipment and workstations are arranged in a line according to the sequence of operations needed to produce the product. Every unit follows the same path.

```{r product-layout-diagram, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Product Layout - Assembly Line", fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
stations <- data.frame(
  name = c("Station 1\nFrame", "Station 2\nEngine", "Station 3\nBody",
           "Station 4\nInterior", "Station 5\nWheels", "Station 6\nQuality"),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
  y = rep(1, 6)
)

ggplot(stations, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_tile(fill = "#3498DB", width = 0.7, height = 0.5, color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = name), color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x + 0.4, xend = x + 0.6, y = y, yend = y),
               data = stations[1:5,],
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")), color = "#2C3E50", size = 1.5) +
  labs(title = "Product Layout: Automotive Assembly Line",
       subtitle = "All products follow the same sequential path") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)) +
  xlim(0.3, 6.7)
```

### Characteristics of Product Layouts

```{r product-characteristics, echo=FALSE}
product_chars <- tibble(
  Advantage = c("High production rate", "Low unit cost", "Low material handling",
                "Simple scheduling", "Less WIP inventory"),
  Disadvantage = c("High initial investment", "Low flexibility", "Line stops affect all",
                   "Monotonous work", "Requires balanced workloads")
)

product_chars %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Product Layout: Advantages vs. Disadvantages") %>%

  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#4472C4", color = "white")
```

<details>
<summary>Quick Quiz: Product Layout</summary>

**Question:** A car wash where vehicles move through a series of cleaning stations is an example of which layout type?

**Answer:** Product Layout - all cars follow the same path through the same sequence of operations.

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hybrid Layout (Cellular Manufacturing)

**Hybrid layouts** combine the flexibility of process layouts with the efficiency of product layouts. The most common type is the **cellular layout** using Group Technology.

### Group Technology Concept

Group Technology (GT) identifies parts with similar characteristics and groups them into **part families**. Machines are then arranged into **cells** to process these families.

```{r cellular-layout, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Cellular Layout with Manufacturing Cells", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Create cells visualization
cell_data <- data.frame(
  cell = c(rep("Cell A\nShaft Family", 4), rep("Cell B\nGear Family", 4), rep("Cell C\nHousing Family", 4)),
  machine = c("Lathe", "Mill", "Drill", "Grind",
              "Mill", "Drill", "Gear Cut", "Inspect",
              "Mill", "Drill", "Bore", "Inspect"),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4),
  y = c(3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1),
  cell_color = c(rep("#E74C3C", 4), rep("#3498DB", 4), rep("#2ECC71", 4))
)

ggplot(cell_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  # Cell backgrounds
  annotate("rect", xmin = 0.5, xmax = 4.5, ymin = 2.6, ymax = 3.4,
           fill = "#E74C3C", alpha = 0.2) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 0.5, xmax = 4.5, ymin = 1.6, ymax = 2.4,
           fill = "#3498DB", alpha = 0.2) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 0.5, xmax = 4.5, ymin = 0.6, ymax = 1.4,
           fill = "#2ECC71", alpha = 0.2) +
  # Machines
  geom_tile(aes(fill = cell_color), width = 0.6, height = 0.4, color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = machine), size = 3, fontface = "bold") +
  # Flow arrows within cells
  geom_segment(data = cell_data[c(1:3, 5:7, 9:11),],
               aes(x = x + 0.35, xend = x + 0.65, y = y, yend = y),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "cm")), color = "black") +
  # Cell labels

  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 2, label = "Cell B\nGears", hjust = 1, fontface = "bold", color = "#3498DB") +
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 1, label = "Cell C\nHousings", hjust = 1, fontface = "bold", color = "#2ECC71") +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  labs(title = "Cellular Layout: Group Technology",
       subtitle = "Parts grouped into families, each processed in dedicated cells") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)) +
  xlim(-0.5, 5)
```

<details>
<summary>Discussion Question: Benefits of Cellular Manufacturing</summary>

**What are the main benefits of cellular manufacturing over traditional process layouts?**

1. **Reduced material handling** - Parts stay within the cell
2. **Shorter lead times** - No waiting between departments
3. **Less WIP inventory** - Smaller batches, faster flow
4. **Improved quality** - Workers responsible for complete part
5. **Team accountability** - Cell teams own their output

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Fixed-Position Layout

In a **fixed-position layout**, the product remains stationary while workers, equipment, and materials are brought to it. This is used when the product is too large or heavy to move.

### Examples of Fixed-Position Layouts

- **Shipbuilding** - Ships built in dry docks
- **Aircraft manufacturing** - Large aircraft assembled in hangars
- **Construction** - Buildings, bridges, dams
- **Surgery** - Patient remains stationary

<details>
<summary>Challenge Question: Managing a Fixed-Position Layout</summary>

**What are the unique challenges of managing a fixed-position layout?**

Think about:
- Scheduling deliveries of materials and equipment
- Coordinating multiple contractors/teams
- Limited space around the product
- Weather and environmental factors (outdoor projects)
- Ensuring safety with many workers in one area

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Designing Process Layouts

Designing an effective process layout involves **three main steps**:

### Step 1: Gather Information

You need to determine:
- **Space requirements** for each department
- **Available space** in the facility
- **Closeness relationships** between departments

#### From-To Matrix (Load Matrix)

A From-To matrix shows the number of trips or loads between departments:

```{r from-to-matrix, echo=FALSE}
# Create a From-To matrix example
from_to <- matrix(c(
  "-", 100, 50, 0, 0,
  0, "-", 200, 50, 0,
  0, 0, "-", 100, 60,
  0, 0, 0, "-", 150,
  0, 0, 0, 0, "-"
), nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE)

colnames(from_to) <- c("Receiving", "Machining", "Assembly", "Painting", "Shipping")
rownames(from_to) <- c("Receiving", "Machining", "Assembly", "Painting", "Shipping")

from_to %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "From-To Matrix: Loads per Day Between Departments") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = FALSE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#4472C4", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, background = "#D6EAF8")
```

### Step 2: Develop Block Plans

Use the **Load-Distance Model** to evaluate layout alternatives:

$$\text{Total Cost} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} L_{ij} \times D_{ij} \times C$$

Where:
- $L_{ij}$ = Number of loads between departments $i$ and $j$
- $D_{ij}$ = Distance between departments $i$ and $j$
- $C$ = Cost per unit distance

### Interactive Example: Comparing Two Layouts

```{r layout-comparison, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Comparing Two Process Layout Alternatives"}
# Layout A
layout_A <- data.frame(
  dept = c("Receiving", "Machining", "Assembly", "Painting", "Shipping"),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  y = rep(1, 5)
)

# Layout B (different arrangement)
layout_B <- data.frame(

# Layout A distances (linear): all adjacent = 1 unit

cat("Layout A Total Load-Distance:", layout_A_score, "\n")

# Layout B distances (compact): most departments closer together
# Receiving to Machining = 1.12 (diagonal)
# Machining to Assembly = 1
# Assembly to Painting = 1.12 (diagonal)
# Painting to Shipping = 1

cat("Layout B Total Load-Distance:", round(layout_B_score, 1), "\n")

cat("\nLayout A is better by:", round(layout_B_score - layout_A_score, 1), "units")
```

<details>
<summary>Why does the linear layout win in this case?</summary>

In this example, the linear layout (A) wins because the process flow is essentially sequential (Receiving → Machining → Assembly → Painting → Shipping).

When flow is **sequential**, a **product layout** (linear arrangement) is more efficient. Process layouts are better when there's **varied routing** between departments.

</details>

### Step 3: Develop Detailed Layout

Once the block plan is selected:
- Determine exact sizes and shapes of departments
- Plan aisle locations and widths
- Consider utilities, safety exits, and accessibility
- Use CAD software or 3D modeling for visualization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Designing Product Layouts (Line Balancing)

The key challenge in product layout design is **line balancing** - assigning tasks to workstations to minimize idle time while meeting production requirements.

### Line Balancing Steps

1. **Identify tasks and precedence relationships**
2. **Calculate required cycle time**
3. **Calculate theoretical minimum number of stations**
4. **Assign tasks to stations**
5. **Calculate efficiency**

### Key Formulas

**Cycle Time:**
$$C = \frac{\text{Available Production Time}}{\text{Desired Output}}$$

**Theoretical Minimum Stations:**
$$TM = \frac{\sum t_i}{C}$$

**Line Efficiency:**
$$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\sum t_i}{n \times C} \times 100\%$$

Where:
- $C$ = Cycle time
- $\sum t_i$ = Total task time
- $n$ = Number of workstations

### Interactive Example: Pizza Assembly Line

```{r pizza-example, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Pizza assembly tasks
pizza_tasks <- tibble(
  Task = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"),
  Description = c("Roll dough", "Spread sauce", "Add cheese", "Add toppings", "Season", "Box pizza"),
  `Time (sec)` = c(40, 25, 20, 35, 15, 30),
  Predecessors = c("-", "A", "B", "B", "C, D", "E")
)

  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = FALSE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#4472C4", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, background = "#FEF9E7", width = "5em")
```

```{r pizza-precedence, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Precedence Diagram for Pizza Assembly", fig.width=9, fig.height=4}
# Create precedence diagram
nodes <- data.frame(
  task = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5),
  y = c(1.5, 1.5, 2, 1, 1.5, 1.5),
  time = c(40, 25, 20, 35, 15, 30)
)

edges <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4),
  y = c(1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2, 1, 1.5),
  xend = c(2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5),
  yend = c(1.5, 2, 1, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5)
)

ggplot() +
  geom_segment(data = edges, aes(x = x + 0.15, y = y, xend = xend - 0.15, yend = yend),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")), color = "#2C3E50", size = 1) +
  geom_point(data = nodes, aes(x = x, y = y), size = 18, color = "#3498DB") +
  geom_text(data = nodes, aes(x = x, y = y, label = paste0(task, "\n", time, "s")),
            color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 3.5) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Precedence Diagram: Pizza Assembly",
       subtitle = "Arrows show required sequence of operations") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)) +
  xlim(0.5, 5.5) + ylim(0.5, 2.5)
```

### Line Balancing Calculation

```{r line-balance-calc, echo=TRUE}
# Given data
total_task_time <- 40 + 25 + 20 + 35 + 15 + 30  # seconds
desired_output <- 60  # pizzas per hour
available_time <- 3600  # seconds per hour

# Step 1: Calculate Cycle Time
cycle_time <- available_time / desired_output
cat("Cycle Time:", cycle_time, "seconds per pizza\n")

# Step 2: Calculate Theoretical Minimum Stations
TM <- total_task_time / cycle_time
cat("Theoretical Minimum Stations:", TM, "=", ceiling(TM), "stations\n")

# Step 3: Assign tasks to stations (one possible solution)
cat("\n--- Workstation Assignments ---\n")
cat("Station 1: A (40s) + B (25s) = 65s > 60s ... EXCEEDS!\n")
cat("Let's try again:\n")
cat("Station 1: A (40s) = 40s [Idle: 20s]\n")
cat("Station 2: B (25s) + D (35s) = 60s [Idle: 0s]\n")
cat("Station 3: C (20s) + E (15s) + F (30s) = 65s > 60s... EXCEEDS!\n")
cat("Revised:\n")
cat("Station 3: C (20s) + E (15s) = 35s [Idle: 25s]\n")
cat("Station 4: F (30s) = 30s [Idle: 30s]\n")

# With 4 stations
n_stations <- 4
efficiency <- (total_task_time / (n_stations * cycle_time)) * 100
cat("\n--- Results ---\n")
cat("Number of Stations:", n_stations, "\n")
cat("Line Efficiency:", round(efficiency, 1), "%\n")
cat("Balance Delay (Idle Time):", round(100 - efficiency, 1), "%\n")
```

<details>
<summary>Try It Yourself: Can you find a better balance?</summary>

**Challenge:** Can you assign tasks to only 3 stations while respecting the precedence constraints?

**Hint:** Consider these assignments:
- Station 1: A (40s) + ?
- Station 2: B (25s) + ? + ?
- Station 3: ? + ?

Remember: Total time per station cannot exceed 60 seconds!

**Solution:** It's actually possible with careful planning:
- Station 1: A (40s) = 40s
- Station 2: B (25s) + C (20s) + E (15s) = 60s (but E needs C AND D complete!)

So 3 stations is NOT feasible due to precedence constraints. The minimum is 4 stations for this problem.

## Warehouse Layout Design

Warehouse layouts are a special case of process layouts focused on **minimizing material handling**.

### Key Principles

1. **Place high-volume items near the dock**
2. **Group items that are often picked together**
3. **Use ABC analysis** for storage assignment:
   - **A items** (20% of SKUs, 80% of picks): Prime locations
   - **B items** (30% of SKUs, 15% of picks): Secondary locations
   - **C items** (50% of SKUs, 5% of picks): Remote locations

```{r warehouse-viz, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Warehouse Layout: ABC Storage Strategy", fig.width=9, fig.height=5}
warehouse <- data.frame(
  zone = c(rep("A Items", 4), rep("B Items", 6), rep("C Items", 10)),
  x = c(1:4, 1:6, 1:10),
  y = c(rep(1, 4), rep(2, 6), rep(3, 10)),
  fill = c(rep("#E74C3C", 4), rep("#F39C12", 6), rep("#3498DB", 10))
)

ggplot(warehouse, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = fill), width = 0.9, height = 0.8, color = "black") +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 0, xmax = 11, ymin = -0.2, ymax = 0.3, fill = "#95A5A6") +
  annotate("text", x = 5.5, y = 0.05, label = "SHIPPING/RECEIVING DOCK", fontface = "bold") +
  annotate("text", x = 2.5, y = 1, label = "A Items\n(Fast Moving)", color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  annotate("text", x = 3.5, y = 2, label = "B Items (Medium)", color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  annotate("text", x = 5.5, y = 3, label = "C Items (Slow Moving)", color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  labs(title = "Warehouse Layout: ABC Storage Strategy",
       subtitle = "High-frequency items placed closest to the dock") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 0.8)
```

## Office Layout Design

Office layouts balance **communication needs** with **privacy requirements**.

### Two Main Approaches

  `Open Plan` = c("Shared workspaces", "Partitions/dividers", "High - easy to reconfigure",
                  "Excellent", "Low", "Lower"),
  `Traditional/Closed` = c("Private offices", "Permanent walls", "Low - expensive to change",
                           "Limited", "High", "Higher")
)

office_types %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Office Layout Comparison") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),

  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#4472C4", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, background = "#D6EAF8")
```

### Key Takeaways

1. **Process layouts** offer flexibility for varied products but have higher material handling costs
2. **Product layouts** are efficient for high-volume, standardized products
3. **Cellular layouts** provide a middle ground with benefits of both
4. **Fixed-position layouts** are necessary when products cannot be moved
5. **Line balancing** is critical for efficient product layouts
6. **Warehouse layouts** should minimize travel distance for high-frequency items

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Practice Problems

<details>
<summary>Problem 1: Layout Selection</summary>

**Scenario:** A company manufactures custom kitchen cabinets. Each order is unique, with different dimensions, materials, and finishes. Production volume is about 50 units per month.

**Question:** Which layout type would you recommend and why?

**Answer:** A **process layout** would be most appropriate because:
- High product variety (custom orders)
- Low production volume
- Different operations needed for each order
- Flexibility is more important than efficiency

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem 2: Line Balancing</summary>

**Given:**
- Total task time: 240 seconds
- Desired output: 30 units per hour
- Available time: 3600 seconds per hour

**Calculate:**
1. Cycle time
2. Theoretical minimum number of stations
3. If you use 3 stations, what is the efficiency?

**Solution:**
1. Cycle time = 3600 / 30 = **120 seconds**
2. TM = 240 / 120 = **2 stations**
3. Efficiency = (240 / (3 × 120)) × 100 = **66.7%**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem 3: Warehouse Layout</summary>

**Scenario:** A warehouse has the following items:
- Item X: 500 picks/day
- Item Y: 100 picks/day
- Item Z: 50 picks/day

**Question:** How should these items be positioned relative to the shipping dock?

**Answer:** Using ABC analysis:
- Item X (high frequency): **Closest to dock** (A zone)
- Item Y (medium frequency): **Middle distance** (B zone)
- Item Z (low frequency): **Farthest from dock** (C zone)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction to Lean Manufacturing

**Lean Manufacturing** is the systematic elimination of waste. The term can be traced to Jim Womack, Daniel Jones, and Daniel Roos' book *The Machine that Changed the World* (1991), which examined the Toyota Production System.

<details>
<summary>What does "Lean" actually mean?</summary>

The term "Lean" refers to cutting "fat" from production activities — eliminating anything that doesn't add value to the customer. Think of it like a lean athlete: no excess weight, maximum efficiency, peak performance.

</details>

### Definition of Lean

```{r lean-definition, echo=FALSE}
lean_def <- tibble(
  Metric = c("Human effort in factory", "Defects in finished product",
             "Engineering effort", "Factory space for same output",
             "In-process inventories"),
  `Lean Target` = c("Half the hours", "Half the defects",
                    "One-third the hours", "Half the space",
                    "A tenth or less")
)

lean_def %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Lean Manufacturing Targets (Womack, Jones, Roos 1990)") %>%

## Evolution of Manufacturing Systems

Manufacturing has evolved through three major paradigms. Understanding this evolution helps us appreciate why Lean emerged as the dominant philosophy.

```{r manufacturing-evolution, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Evolution of Manufacturing Systems", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

  )
```

### Comparison of Manufacturing Systems

```{r mfg-comparison-table, echo=FALSE}
mfg_compare <- tibble(
  Characteristic = c("Time Period", "Process", "Workforce", "Components",
                     "Quality", "Cost", "Volume", "Flexibility"),
  `Craft Manufacturing` = c("Late 1800s", "Built on blocks, workers walk around",
                            "Craftsmen with pride", "Hand-crafted, hand-fitted",
                            "Excellent", "Very expensive", "Few produced", "Very high"),
  `Mass Manufacturing` = c("1920s (Ford)", "Assembly line",
                           "Low skilled, simplistic jobs", "Interchangeable parts",

  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, background = "#ECF0F1", width = "10em")
```

<details>
<summary>Discussion: Why did Mass Manufacturing dominate for so long?</summary>

Mass manufacturing dominated because:

1. **Economies of scale** - Higher volume = lower unit cost
2. **Predictable demand** - Post-war boom created stable markets
3. **Limited competition** - Few global competitors
4. **Consumer acceptance** - "Any color as long as it's black" (Henry Ford)

**What changed?**
- Global competition (especially from Japan)
- Customers demanded variety and quality
- Product lifecycles shortened
- Technology enabled flexibility

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Toyota Production System (TPS)

The most influential lean manufacturing model is the **Toyota Production System (TPS)**, developed by Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo at Toyota.

### Historical Context

```{r tps-timeline, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Toyota's Journey to Lean Excellence", fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
timeline_data <- data.frame(
  year = c(1949, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990),
  event = c("Toyota near\nbankruptcy", "Ohno begins\nJIT development",
            "Kanban system\nimplemented", "TPS refined\nand documented",
            "TPS studied\nby West", "\"Lean\" term\ncoined"),
  y = rep(0, 6)
)

ggplot(timeline_data, aes(x = year, y = y)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "#2C3E50", size = 2) +
  geom_point(size = 8, color = "#E74C3C") +
  geom_text(aes(label = year), vjust = -2.5, fontface = "bold", size = 4) +
  geom_text(aes(label = event), vjust = 2.5, size = 3, lineheight = 0.8) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "The Evolution of Toyota Production System") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14)) +
  ylim(-1.5, 1.5) +
  xlim(1945, 1995)
```

**In 1949**, Toyota was on the brink of bankruptcy. Ford's car production was at least **8 times more efficient** than Toyota's.

> **Kiichiro Toyoda's Challenge:** "To achieve the same rate of production as the United States in three years."

**Taiichi Ohno** accepted this challenge. Inspired by American supermarkets, he developed the Just-in-Time method.

### Two Pillars of TPS

```{r tps-pillars, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The Two Pillars of Toyota Production System", fig.width=8, fig.height=5}

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14)) +
  xlim(-0.5, 8.5) + ylim(-0.5, 6.5)
```

**1. Just-in-Time (JIT):** Produce only what is needed, when it is needed, in the amount needed.

**2. Jidoka (Built-in Quality):** Automation with a human touch — stop production immediately when a defect is detected.

## The 3 M's of Lean

Lean manufacturing focuses on eliminating three types of inefficiency, known as the **3 M's**:

## The Seven Types of Waste (MUDA)

**Shigeo Shingo** identified seven categories of waste common to manufacturing. These are activities that add cost without adding value.

<summary>Memory Aid: TIMWOOD</summary>

Use **TIMWOOD** to remember the seven wastes:

- **T**ransportation
- **I**nventory
- **M**otion
- **W**aiting
- **O**verproduction
- **O**ver-processing
- **D**efects

Some people also use **DOWNTIME** (adding "Non-utilized talent" as an 8th waste).

<details>
<summary>Interactive Exercise: Identify the Waste</summary>

**Scenario 1:** A worker walks 50 feet to get a tool, uses it for 30 seconds, then walks back.

**Answer:** This is **Motion** waste. The solution would be to place tools at the point of use (5S).

**Scenario 2:** A machine produces 1000 parts, but only 800 are needed this week.

**Answer:** This is **Overproduction** waste. The solution would be to implement pull production based on actual demand.

**Scenario 3:** Parts sit in a queue for 3 days before being processed at the next station.

**Answer:** This is both **Inventory** and **Waiting** waste. The solution would be to balance the line and implement one-piece flow.

### Formulas and Calculations

**Takt Time** — The pace of production to meet customer demand:

$$\text{Takt Time} = \frac{\text{Available Production Time}}{\text{Customer Demand}}$$

**Cycle Time** — Time to complete one unit at a workstation:

$$\text{Cycle Time} = \frac{\text{Net Operating Time}}{\text{Units Produced}}$$

**Throughput Time** — Total time from start to finish:

$$\text{Throughput Time} = \text{Processing} + \text{Inspection} + \text{Queue} + \text{Move Time}$$

### Interactive Example: Calculating Takt Time

```{r takt-calculation, echo=TRUE}
# Given data
available_time_per_day <- 8 * 60  # 8 hours = 480 minutes
breaks_and_meetings <- 60         # 60 minutes for breaks/meetings
customer_demand <- 240            # 240 units per day

# Calculate net available time
net_available_time <- available_time_per_day - breaks_and_meetings
cat("Net Available Time:", net_available_time, "minutes/day\n")

# Calculate Takt Time
takt_time <- net_available_time / customer_demand
cat("Takt Time:", takt_time, "minutes per unit\n")
cat("Takt Time:", takt_time * 60, "seconds per unit\n")

# Interpretation
cat("\n--- Interpretation ---\n")
cat("To meet customer demand, we must produce 1 unit every",
    takt_time, "minutes (", takt_time * 60, "seconds).\n")
```

<details>
<summary>Practice Problem: Calculate Your Takt Time</summary>

**Given:**
- Shift length: 10 hours
- Two 15-minute breaks and one 30-minute lunch
- Customer requires 300 units per shift

**Calculate:**
1. Net available production time
2. Takt time in minutes
3. Takt time in seconds

**Solution:**
```
Net time = (10 × 60) - (15 + 15 + 30) = 600 - 60 = 540 minutes
Takt time = 540 / 300 = 1.8 minutes = 108 seconds per unit
```

## Setup Reduction (SMED)

**SMED** (Single Minute Exchange of Dies) is a methodology developed by Shigeo Shingo to dramatically reduce changeover time.

### The SMED Concept

```{r smed-viz, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="SMED: Internal vs External Setup", fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
# Before SMED
before <- data.frame(
  activity = c("Get tools", "Remove old die", "Install new die", "Adjust settings", "Get materials", "First article"),
  time = c(15, 30, 45, 20, 10, 10),
  type = c("External", "Internal", "Internal", "Internal", "External", "Internal"),
  x_start = c(0, 15, 45, 90, 110, 120),
  scenario = "BEFORE SMED"
)
before$x_end <- before$x_start + before$time

# After SMED
after <- data.frame(
  activity = c("Install new die", "Adjust settings", "First article"),
  time = c(30, 15, 5),
  type = c("Internal", "Internal", "Internal"),
  x_start = c(0, 30, 45),
  scenario = "AFTER SMED"
)
after$x_end <- after$x_start + after$time

ggplot() +
  # Before SMED bars
  geom_rect(data = before, aes(xmin = x_start, xmax = x_end, ymin = 1.6, ymax = 2,
                                fill = type), color = "black") +
  geom_text(data = before, aes(x = (x_start + x_end)/2, y = 1.8, label = activity),

<summary>Case Study: Press Setup Reduction</summary>

**Problem:** Presses were idle more than 50% of the time due to setup.
- Average production run: 1-2 days
- Setup time: 1-2 days

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Using standard bolt fasteners with open-end wrenches
- No pre-staging of tools or dies
- Sequential operations that could be parallel

**Solutions Implemented:**

| Change | Time Saved |
|--------|------------|
| Socket sets + power tools | 10% |
| Quick-release clamps | 50% |
| Pre-staging materials | 20% |
| Parallel operations | 20% |

**Result:** Setup time reduced from 1-2 days to 4-6 hours, with a target of under 1 hour.

## Kaizen: Continuous Improvement

**Kaizen** (改善) means "change for the better" — the philosophy of continuous, incremental improvement.

# Create PDCA cycle
pdca <- data.frame(
  step = c("PLAN", "DO", "CHECK", "ACT"),

  color = c("#3498DB", "#2ECC71", "#F39C12", "#E74C3C"),
  description = c("Identify\nopportunity", "Test\nsolution", "Measure\nresults", "Standardize\nor adjust")
)

  labs(title = "Plan-Do-Check-Act: The Engine of Kaizen") +
  coord_fixed() +
  xlim(-3.5, 3.5) + ylim(-3.5, 3.5)
```

### Key Kaizen Concepts

- **Everyone participates** — from CEO to frontline workers
- **Small, incremental changes** — not major overhauls
- **Focus on process** — blame the process, not the person
- **Data-driven decisions** — measure before and after
- **Standardize improvements** — lock in gains

## Review Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: What are the seven types of waste, and which is often considered the most impactful?</summary>

The seven types of waste (TIMWOOD) are:
1. **T**ransportation
2. **I**nventory
3. **M**otion
4. **W**aiting
5. **O**verproduction
6. **O**ver-processing
7. **D**efects

**Inventory** is often considered the most impactful because it hides other problems, ties up capital, and can become obsolete.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Explain the difference between Push and Pull production systems.</summary>

**Push System:**
- Production based on forecasts
- Materials pushed through the system
- Results in high inventory
- Problems hidden by buffer stock

**Pull System:**
- Production triggered by actual demand
- Materials pulled by downstream operations
- Minimal inventory
- Problems immediately visible

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Calculate the Takt time for a facility with 450 minutes of available time and demand of 150 units.</summary>

$$\text{Takt Time} = \frac{450 \text{ minutes}}{150 \text{ units}} = 3 \text{ minutes per unit}$$

This means we need to produce one unit every 3 minutes (180 seconds) to meet customer demand.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: What is the difference between internal and external setup in SMED?</summary>

**Internal Setup:** Activities that can ONLY be performed when the machine is stopped (e.g., physically removing the old die).

**External Setup:** Activities that CAN be performed while the machine is still running (e.g., getting tools, pre-staging the next die, preparing materials).

The key to SMED is converting as many internal activities to external as possible.

## Introduction: The Safety Hierarchy

In process engineering, safety is not merely a feature added at the end of a project; it is a **fundamental design constraint**. Before deploying safety devices, the engineer must apply the **Hierarchy of Controls** — a systematic approach to eliminating or reducing workplace hazards.

<summary>Discussion: Why not just rely on PPE?</summary>

**PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)** is the least effective control because:

1. **It doesn't eliminate the hazard** — the danger still exists
2. **It depends on human compliance** — workers may forget or choose not to wear it
3. **It can fail** — equipment degrades, doesn't fit properly, or is damaged
4. **It's the last line of defense** — if PPE fails, the worker is exposed

**Key Principle:** The more we can design out hazards through engineering controls, the less we depend on human behavior to keep people safe.

## Physical Guarding and Interlocks

Physical barriers are the most intuitive form of protection. They create a "hard" separation between the operator and moving parts, ensuring that humans cannot enter the danger zone during machine operation.

```{r guarding-types-viz, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Types of Physical Guarding", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Create visualization of different guard types
guard_data <- data.frame(
  type = c("Fixed Guard", "Interlocked Gate", "Adjustable Guard", "Self-Adjusting Guard"),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  protection = c(5, 5, 3, 3),
  flexibility = c(1, 3, 4, 5),
  cost = c(1, 3, 2, 4),
  color = c("#3498DB", "#E74C3C", "#F39C12", "#9B59B6")
)

guard_long <- guard_data %>%
  select(type, x, protection, flexibility) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(protection, flexibility),
               names_to = "metric", values_to = "value")

ggplot(guard_long, aes(x = type, y = value, fill = metric)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = "black", width = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("protection" = "#27AE60", "flexibility" = "#3498DB"),
                    labels = c("Flexibility", "Protection Level"),
                    name = "Metric") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:5, labels = c("Low", "", "Medium", "", "High")) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Physical Guard Types",
       subtitle = "Protection vs. Flexibility trade-off",
       x = "Guard Type", y = "Rating") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 20, hjust = 1, size = 10),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

### Fixed Guards

**Fixed guards** are permanent barriers that require tools to remove. They are the simplest and most reliable form of protection.

```{r fixed-guard-table, echo=FALSE}
fixed_guards <- tibble(
  `Characteristic` = c("Construction", "Removal", "Best Application",
                       "Advantages", "Disadvantages"),
  `Description` = c("Wire mesh, polycarbonate sheets, or solid metal panels",
                    "Requires tools (screws, bolts) to remove",
                    "Areas that need infrequent access for maintenance only",
                    "Simple, reliable, low cost, no moving parts to fail",
                    "Impedes visibility, slows maintenance, can be removed and not replaced")
)

fixed_guards %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Fixed Guards: Key Characteristics") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#3498DB", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "12em")
```

### Interlocked Guards

**Interlocked guards** are access points equipped with sensors. When the guard is opened, the safety controller initiates a stop.

```{r interlock-diagram, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Interlocked Guard Operation Principle", fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
ggplot() +
  # Machine representation
  annotate("rect", xmin = 3, xmax = 7, ymin = 1, ymax = 4,
           fill = "#95A5A6", color = "black", size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = 5, y = 2.5, label = "MACHINE\n(Hazard Zone)",
           fontface = "bold", size = 4) +
  # Guard door - closed position
  annotate("rect", xmin = 2.8, xmax = 3, ymin = 1.5, ymax = 3.5,
           fill = "#F39C12", color = "black", size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.8, y = 2.5, label = "Guard\nDoor", size = 3) +
  # Interlock switch
  annotate("point", x = 2.9, y = 3.3, size = 4, color = "#E74C3C") +
  annotate("text", x = 2.2, y = 3.5, label = "Interlock\nSwitch", size = 2.5) +
  # Safety controller

  annotate("text", x = 1, y = 1, label = "Safety\nPLC", size = 3, fontface = "bold") +
  # Connection lines
  annotate("segment", x = 2.9, xend = 1.5, y = 3.3, yend = 1.5,
           linetype = "dashed", color = "#E74C3C", size = 1) +
  annotate("segment", x = 1.5, xend = 3, y = 1, yend = 1,
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")), color = "#2ECC71", size = 1) +
  # Labels

  # Status indicators
  annotate("rect", xmin = 8, xmax = 10, ymin = 3, ymax = 4, fill = "#D5F5E3", color = "black") +
  annotate("text", x = 9, y = 3.5, label = "Door Closed\n= Machine Runs", size = 3) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 8, xmax = 10, ymin = 1.5, ymax = 2.5, fill = "#FADBD8", color = "black") +
  annotate("text", x = 9, y = 2, label = "Door Open\n= Machine Stops", size = 3) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Interlocked Guard System",
       subtitle = "Opening the guard door breaks the safety circuit") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10))
```

### Stop Categories

When an interlock is triggered, the machine must stop. The **stop category** determines how this happens:

```{r stop-categories, echo=FALSE}
stop_cat <- tibble(
  `Category` = c("**Category 0**", "**Category 1**", "**Category 2**"),
  `Type` = c("Uncontrolled Stop", "Controlled Stop", "Controlled Stop"),
  `Method` = c("Immediate removal of power to actuators",
               "Controlled deceleration, then power removed",
               "Controlled stop with power maintained"),
  `Application` = c("Emergency stops, dangerous machines",
                    "High-inertia machines, robots",
                    "Process that cannot be interrupted abruptly"),
  `Example` = c("Press brake E-stop", "Industrial robot guard open", "CNC spindle during tool change")
)

stop_cat %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Machine Stop Categories (IEC 60204-1)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#E74C3C", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "8em")
```

### Trapped Key Systems (Lock-Out/Tag-Out)

**Trapped key systems** use a mechanical sequence to ensure that a machine cannot be energized unless all access keys are returned to the control panel.

```{r loto-sequence, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Trapped Key System Sequence", fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
loto_steps <- data.frame(
  step = 1:5,
  action = c("Turn off\nmachine", "Lock out\npower", "Remove key\nfrom panel",
             "Key opens\naccess gate", "Gate key\ntrapped inside"),
  x = 1:5
)

ggplot(loto_steps, aes(x = x, y = 1)) +
  # Step circles
  geom_point(size = 18, color = "#3498DB") +
  geom_text(aes(label = step), color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 6) +
  # Action labels
  geom_text(aes(y = 0.5, label = action), size = 3, lineheight = 0.8) +
  # Arrows
  geom_segment(data = loto_steps[1:4,],
               aes(x = x + 0.4, xend = x + 0.6, y = 1, yend = 1),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")), color = "#2C3E50", size = 1) +
  # Return arrow
  annotate("curve", x = 5, xend = 1, y = 1.6, yend = 1.6,
           curvature = -0.3, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")),
           color = "#27AE60", size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate("text", x = 3, y = 1.85, label = "To restart: Reverse sequence",
           color = "#27AE60", fontface = "italic", size = 3) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Trapped Key System: Ensuring Safe Access",
       subtitle = "Machine cannot restart until key is returned") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)) +
  ylim(0, 2.2)
```

<summary>Case Study: The Fatal Bypass</summary>

**Incident:** A maintenance worker was killed when a robot arm unexpectedly activated while he was inside a robotic cell.

**What Happened:**
- The guard interlock had been bypassed with a "defeat device" (a magnet taped to fool the sensor)
- Workers had bypassed the interlock because it slowed down troubleshooting
- The bypass had been in place for months without management knowledge

**Root Causes:**
1. Interlock caused inconvenience during frequent troubleshooting
2. No monitoring system to detect bypasses
3. Culture that tolerated "workarounds"

**Lessons Learned:**
- Design interlocks that don't impede normal operations
- Use tamper-evident or tamper-resistant devices
- Regular safety audits to detect bypasses
- Zero-tolerance policy for defeating safety devices

> **Never bypass a safety device, even temporarily.**

## Presence-Sensing Devices

Presence-sensing devices allow for a **"fence-less" environment**, improving visibility and ergonomics while maintaining high safety levels. They detect when a person enters a hazardous zone and trigger a machine stop.

### Light Curtains

**Light curtains** use a transmitter and receiver to create an array of infrared beams. If any beam is broken, the safety circuit is interrupted.

### Pressure-Sensitive Safety Mats

**Pressure-sensitive mats** detect the presence of a person standing on them. They are used primarily in legacy systems or specific zones where optical sensors may be obscured.

<summary>When to Use Pressure Mats vs. Optical Sensors</summary>

**Use Pressure Mats When:**
- Environment has heavy dust, smoke, or steam (blinds optical sensors)
- Detection area is well-defined and doesn't change
- Workers need to stand in a specific location
- Budget is limited

**Use Optical Sensors When:**
- Flexibility in zone configuration is needed
- Environment is relatively clean
- Detection area is large or needs to change
- Higher integrity level is required

**Hybrid Approach:** Many modern systems use both — area scanners for perimeter protection and pressure mats for specific danger zones near the machine.

## Control-Actuated Safety Devices

These devices ensure that the operator's body—specifically their hands—is in a predetermined **safe location** before the machine can cycle.

### Two-Hand Controls

**Two-hand controls** are common in pressing or stamping operations. To initiate a cycle, the operator must press two buttons simultaneously.

```{r two-hand-diagram, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Two-Hand Control System", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

### Enable/Deadman Switches

**Enable switches** (also called deadman switches) are used during **Teach Mode** for robotics. The operator must hold a three-position trigger in the **middle** position.

<details>
<summary>Why Three Positions?</summary>

The three-position design accounts for **two natural human reactions** to danger:

1. **Panic (Release):** When frightened, people often release what they're holding — robot stops.
2. **Startle (Squeeze):** When startled, people often grip tighter — robot stops.

Only a deliberate, controlled **middle hold** allows the robot to move. This is fundamental to safe teach pendant operation.

## Collaborative Robotics (Cobots)

**Collaborative robots (cobots)** represent a shift from "separation" to "collaboration." They rely on sophisticated internal sensors rather than external cages, allowing humans and robots to work in the same space.

### Collaborative Operation Methods

ISO 10218 and ISO/TS 15066 define **four methods** for safe collaborative operation:

```{r cobot-methods, echo=FALSE}
cobot_methods <- tibble(
  `Method` = c("**Safety-Rated Monitored Stop**",
               "**Hand Guiding**",
               "**Speed and Separation Monitoring**",
               "**Power and Force Limiting**"),
  `How It Works` = c("Robot stops when human enters workspace, resumes when clear",
                     "Operator physically guides robot through motions",
                     "Robot slows or stops based on human proximity",
                     "Robot limits force/power to safe levels on contact"),
  `Sensors Used` = c("Area scanners, light curtains",

  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "15em")
```

### Power and Force Limiting (PFL)

The most common cobot safety method is **Power and Force Limiting**. The robot detects a change in torque in its joints. If it bumps into a human, it stops before a regulated amount of force is exceeded.

```{r pfl-limits, echo=FALSE}
pfl_limits <- tibble(
  `Body Region` = c("Skull/Forehead", "Face", "Neck", "Back/Shoulders",

  `Maximum Force (N)` = c(130, 65, 150, 210, 140, 110, 140),
  `Risk Level` = c("Critical", "Critical", "Critical", "Moderate",
                   "Moderate", "Moderate", "Lower")
)

```

<summary>Discussion: Are Cobots Always Safe?</summary>

**Common Misconception:** "Cobots are safe, so we don't need to do a risk assessment."

**Reality:** Cobots are *potentially* safe, but a **risk assessment is always required**.

**Factors that can make a cobot unsafe:**

1. **End-of-arm tooling** — A soft gripper is different from a sharp blade
2. **Workpiece** — Carrying a heavy or sharp object increases risk
3. **Speed** — Even force-limited robots can cause injury at high speed
4. **Application** — Some tasks bring humans closer to hazards
5. **Environment** — Slippery floors, confined spaces, etc.

> **Every collaborative application requires a documented risk assessment per ISO 12100.**

## Safety Distance Calculation

A safety device cannot be placed arbitrarily. It must be far enough away that the machine comes to a **complete halt** before the human can reach the hazard.

### The Safety Distance Formula

The minimum safety distance $S$ is calculated as:

$$S = (K \times T) + C$$

Where:

- **$K$**: The hand/body approach speed (standardized values)
- **$T$**: The total stopping time of the system (device response + machine stop time)
- **$C$**: The "penetration depth" (how far a hand can reach through before being detected)

### Standard Values for K

```{r k-values, echo=FALSE}
k_values <- tibble(
  `Approach Type` = c("Hand/Arm Approach (fast)", "Hand/Arm Approach (normal)",
                      "Walking Approach", "Standing Reach"),
  `K Value (mm/s)` = c("2000", "1600", "1600", "0 (static)"),
  `When to Use` = c("Close approach to point of operation",

  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#3498DB", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "15em")
```

### Penetration Depth (C)

The penetration depth depends on the **resolution** of the sensing device:

```{r c-values, echo=FALSE}
c_values <- tibble(
  `Resolution (mm)` = c("≤14", ">14 to ≤20", ">20 to ≤30", ">30 to ≤40", ">40"),
  `C Value (mm)` = c("0", "80", "130", "240", "850"),
  `Detection Type` = c("Finger detection", "Finger/Hand", "Hand detection",
                       "Hand/Arm", "Body detection")
)

c_values %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Penetration Depth Values Based on Resolution") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#9B59B6", color = "white")
```

### Example Calculation

```{r safety-calc-example, echo=TRUE}
# Given parameters
K <- 2000        # Approach speed (mm/s) - fast hand approach
T_device <- 0.020  # Light curtain response time (20 ms = 0.020 s)
T_machine <- 0.150 # Machine stopping time (150 ms = 0.150 s)
C <- 0           # Penetration depth for 14mm resolution

# Calculate total stopping time
T_total <- T_device + T_machine
cat("Total stopping time (T):", T_total * 1000, "ms\n")

# Calculate minimum safety distance
S <- (K * T_total) + C
cat("Minimum safety distance (S):", S, "mm\n")
cat("Minimum safety distance (S):", S / 25.4, "inches\n")

# Interpretation
cat("\n--- Interpretation ---\n")
cat("The light curtain must be at least", S, "mm from the hazard.\n")
cat("This ensures the machine stops before a person can reach the danger zone.\n")
```

<details>
<summary>Practice Problem: Calculate Safety Distance</summary>

**Given:**
- Light curtain resolution: 30mm (hand detection)
- Light curtain response time: 15ms
- Machine stopping time: 200ms
- Application: Operator hand approach

**Calculate the minimum safety distance.**

**Solution:**
```
K = 1600 mm/s (normal hand approach)
T = 0.015 + 0.200 = 0.215 seconds
C = 130 mm (for 30mm resolution)

S = (K × T) + C
S = (1600 × 0.215) + 130
S = 344 + 130
S = 474 mm (approximately 18.7 inches)
```

The light curtain must be installed at least **474mm** from the nearest hazard point.

## Emergency Stop (E-Stop) Systems

The **Emergency Stop** is the "last resort" — it is not a safety device but a **complementary protective measure**. It must be available to stop the machine when all other measures have failed.

```{r estop-design, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="E-Stop Design Requirements", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

### E-Stop Pull Cords

For long conveyors or machines where an operator cannot quickly reach a fixed button, **pull cords** provide continuous E-Stop coverage.

<summary>Common E-Stop Mistakes</summary>

**Mistake 1: Using E-Stop for normal stopping**
- E-Stops are for emergencies only
- Normal stops should use a separate control
- Frequent E-Stop use causes wear and desensitizes operators

**Mistake 2: E-Stop that doesn't stop everything**
- All hazardous motion must stop
- Auxiliary equipment (conveyors, feeders) often forgotten
- Review entire system, not just the primary machine

**Mistake 3: Automatic restart after E-Stop reset**
- Machine must NOT automatically restart when E-Stop is released
- Separate "Start" action required
- This prevents unexpected motion after reset

**Mistake 4: Hidden or blocked E-Stops**
- E-Stops must be visible and accessible
- Guard placement sometimes blocks access
- Regular audits needed to ensure accessibility

## Functional Safety Standards

Modern safety systems must meet specific **performance levels** to ensure reliability. Two main frameworks exist:

### Safety Integrity Levels (SIL) - IEC 62061

```{r sil-levels, echo=FALSE}
sil_data <- tibble(
  `SIL Level` = c("SIL 1", "SIL 2", "SIL 3"),
  `PFH Range` = c("≥10⁻⁶ to <10⁻⁵", "≥10⁻⁷ to <10⁻⁶", "≥10⁻⁸ to <10⁻⁷"),
  `Approximate Meaning` = c("Dangerous failure less than once per 11 years",
                             "Dangerous failure less than once per 114 years",
                             "Dangerous failure less than once per 1,140 years"),
  `Typical Application` = c("Low-risk tasks", "Most industrial machinery", "High-risk processes")
)

sil_data %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Safety Integrity Levels (PFH = Probability of Dangerous Failure per Hour)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),

  row_spec(2, background = "#FEF9E7") %>%
  row_spec(3, background = "#FADBD8") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
```

### Performance Levels (PL) - ISO 13849-1

```{r pl-levels, echo=FALSE}
pl_data <- tibble(
  `Performance Level` = c("PL a", "PL b", "PL c", "PL d", "PL e"),
  `PFH Range` = c("≥10⁻⁵ to <10⁻⁴", "≥3×10⁻⁶ to <10⁻⁵",
                  "≥10⁻⁶ to <3×10⁻⁶", "≥10⁻⁷ to <10⁻⁶", "≥10⁻⁸ to <10⁻⁷"),
  `Risk Reduction` = c("Lowest", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Highest"),
  `Equivalent SIL` = c("< SIL 1", "SIL 1", "SIL 1", "SIL 2", "SIL 3")
)

pl_data %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Performance Levels per ISO 13849-1") %>%

rel_data <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  pl = c("PL a", "PL b", "PL c", "PL d", "PL e"),
  sil = c(0.5, 1, 1, 2, 3),
  color = c("#D5F5E3", "#D5F5E3", "#FEF9E7", "#FEF9E7", "#FADBD8")
)

ggplot(rel_data, aes(x = x, y = sil)) +

  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

<details>
<summary>Which Standard to Use: SIL or PL?</summary>

**Use ISO 13849-1 (Performance Levels) when:**
- Designing safety functions for standard machinery
- Using off-the-shelf safety components
- Simpler systems with well-defined safety functions

**Use IEC 62061 (SIL) when:**
- Complex programmable systems (safety PLCs)
- Process industries
- When customer or regulation specifies SIL

**Note:** Many modern systems use both standards, as they are harmonized and can be used together. The choice often depends on industry practice and customer requirements.

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Risk Assessment Process

Before selecting any safety device, a **risk assessment** must be performed. This is required by ISO 12100.

```{r risk-assessment-process, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Risk Assessment Process (ISO 12100)", fig.width=10, fig.height=7}

        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)) +

```

### Risk Estimation

Risk is typically estimated using three factors:

```{r risk-matrix, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Risk Estimation Matrix", fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
# Create risk matrix
risk_matrix <- expand.grid(
  Severity = c("Minor", "Moderate", "Serious", "Fatal"),

risk_matrix$Risk <- c(
  "Low", "Low", "Medium", "Medium",
  "Low", "Medium", "Medium", "High",
  "Medium", "Medium", "High", "High",
  "Medium", "High", "High", "Critical"
)
risk_matrix$RiskNum <- c(1,1,2,2, 1,2,2,3, 2,2,3,3, 2,3,3,4)

ggplot(risk_matrix, aes(x = Probability, y = Severity, fill = Risk)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white", size = 1.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = Risk), fontface = "bold", size = 4) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Low" = "#27AE60", "Medium" = "#F39C12",
                               "High" = "#E74C3C", "Critical" = "#8E44AD")) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Remote", "Unlikely", "Possible", "Probable"),
                   position = "top") +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = c("Minor", "Moderate", "Serious", "Fatal")) +

## Review Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: What are the five levels of the Hierarchy of Controls, and why is PPE the least effective?</summary>

The five levels are (from most to least effective):

1. **Elimination** — Physically remove the hazard
2. **Substitution** — Replace with something less hazardous
3. **Engineering Controls** — Isolate people from the hazard
4. **Administrative Controls** — Change how people work
5. **PPE** — Protect the worker with equipment

**PPE is least effective because:**
- The hazard still exists
- It depends on human compliance
- Equipment can fail or be worn incorrectly
- It's the last line of defense

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: A light curtain has a response time of 12ms and resolution of 14mm. The machine takes 180ms to stop. Calculate the minimum safety distance for hand approach.</summary>

**Given:**
- K = 2000 mm/s (hand approach, use higher value for safety)
- T = 0.012 + 0.180 = 0.192 seconds
- C = 0 mm (14mm resolution)

**Calculation:**
$$S = (K \times T) + C$$
$$S = (2000 \times 0.192) + 0$$
$$S = 384 \text{ mm}$$

The light curtain must be installed at least **384mm** (approximately 15 inches) from the hazard.

<summary>Question 3: Explain why a three-position enable switch stops the robot in both position 1 (released) and position 3 (fully pressed).</summary>

The three-position design accounts for two natural human reactions to danger:

**Position 1 (Released):**
- When frightened, people often release what they're holding (panic response)
- Robot stops immediately

**Position 3 (Fully Pressed):**
- When startled, people often grip tighter (startle response)
- Robot stops immediately

**Position 2 (Middle):**
- Only a deliberate, controlled hold allows operation
- Requires conscious effort to maintain
- This ensures the operator is alert and in control

<summary>Question 4: What are the four methods of collaborative robot operation according to ISO 10218?</summary>

1. **Safety-Rated Monitored Stop**
   - Robot stops when human enters workspace
   - Resumes when human leaves
   - Uses area scanners or light curtains

2. **Hand Guiding**
   - Operator physically guides robot
   - Force/torque sensors enable safe teaching

3. **Speed and Separation Monitoring**
   - Robot speed varies based on human proximity
   - Uses external sensors to track human position

4. **Power and Force Limiting (PFL)**
   - Robot limits contact force to safe levels
   - Built-in joint torque sensors
   - Most common cobot method

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: What are the requirements for an E-Stop button according to IEC 60204-1?</summary>

**Physical Requirements:**
- **Color:** Red
- **Shape:** Mushroom head (palm or fist operated)
- **Background:** Yellow (high contrast)

**Functional Requirements:**
- **Self-latching:** Stays activated when pressed
- **Manual reset:** Requires deliberate action to release
- **Accessibility:** Within easy reach of all operators
- **Wiring:** Normally closed contacts (fail-safe)
- **Function:** Category 0 or Category 1 stop
- **No automatic restart:** Separate start action required after reset

## What is Ergonomics?

**Ergonomics** (from Greek *ergon* = work, *nomos* = laws) is the scientific discipline focused on understanding the interactions between humans and other elements of a system, with the goal of optimizing human well-being and overall system performance.

<summary>The Cost of Ignoring Ergonomics</summary>

**Direct Costs:**
- Workers' compensation claims
- Medical expenses
- Legal fees
- Increased insurance premiums

**Indirect Costs (often 4-10x direct costs):**
- Lost productivity
- Training replacement workers
- Reduced quality
- Overtime to cover absent workers
- Administrative time
- Low morale

**Statistics:**
- MSDs account for **33%** of all workplace injuries
- Average MSD claim costs **$15,000-$20,000**
- Lost workdays due to MSDs average **12 days** per case
- Carpal tunnel surgery costs approximately **$30,000** per case (including lost time)

## The Seven Ergonomic Risk Factors

The **Initial Ergonomic Risk Assessment (INERA)** identifies seven primary risk factors that contribute to musculoskeletal disorders. Understanding these factors is the first step in prevention.

```{r risk-factors-viz, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The Seven Ergonomic Risk Factors", fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

### Risk Factor 1: Awkward Postures

**Neutral posture** is the position where joints are naturally aligned, minimizing stress on muscles, tendons, and skeletal system. Any deviation from neutral increases injury risk.

```

```{r neutral-postures, echo=FALSE}
neutral <- tibble(
  `Body Part` = c("**Head/Neck**", "**Shoulders**", "**Elbows**", "**Wrists**", "**Back**", "**Hips/Knees**"),
  `Neutral Position` = c("Balanced on spine, looking straight ahead",
                         "Relaxed, arms at sides",
                         "Close to body, bent 90-120°",

  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "10em") %>%
  column_spec(3, background = "#FADBD8")
```

### Risk Factor 2: Repetition

**Repetitive motion** is one of the most significant risk factors in manufacturing. The risk increases with:

- **Frequency:** How often the motion occurs
- **Duration:** How long the task is performed
- **Recovery time:** Rest between repetitions

```{r repetition-thresholds, echo=FALSE}
repetition <- tibble(
  `Cycle Time` = c("> 30 seconds", "15-30 seconds", "< 15 seconds"),
  `Repetitions/Hour` = c("< 120", "120-240", "> 240"),
  `Risk Level` = c("Low", "Moderate", "High"),
  `Action Required` = c("Monitor", "Investigate and consider changes", "Immediate intervention needed")
)

repetition %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Repetition Risk Thresholds") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#C0392B", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(1, background = "#D5F5E3") %>%
  row_spec(2, background = "#FEF9E7") %>%
  row_spec(3, background = "#FADBD8")
```

### Risk Factor 3: Force

The amount of **physical effort** required significantly impacts injury risk. Force requirements depend on:

```{r force-factors, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Factors Affecting Force Requirements", fig.width=9, fig.height=5}
force_data <- data.frame(
  factor = c("Object Weight", "Grip Type", "Posture", "Friction", "Acceleration"),
  impact = c(5, 4, 4, 3, 3),
  example = c("Heavier = more force", "Pinch vs. power grip", "Awkward = more force",
              "Slippery = more grip", "Fast moves = more force")
)

ggplot(force_data, aes(x = reorder(factor, impact), y = impact)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#F39C12", color = "black", width = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = example), hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 7)) +
  labs(title = "Factors That Increase Force Requirements",
       x = "", y = "Relative Impact") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

<details>
<summary>Interactive Exercise: Identify the Risk Factors</summary>

**Scenario:** An assembly line worker performs the following task 400 times per shift:

1. Reaches overhead to grab a part from a bin
2. Holds the part while inserting 4 screws with a power screwdriver
3. Places the completed assembly on a conveyor
4. The workstation has poor lighting and the floor is concrete

**Identify all risk factors present:**

**Answer:**
1. **Awkward Posture** - Reaching overhead
2. **Repetition** - 400 cycles per shift
3. **Force** - Gripping parts, controlling screwdriver
4. **Static Position** - Holding part during assembly
5. **Vibration** - Power screwdriver
6. **Contact Stress** - Standing on concrete (feet)
7. **Environmental** - Poor lighting

*This task has ALL SEVEN risk factors present!*

## Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs)

**Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs)** are injuries and disorders affecting muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage, and spinal discs. They are the most common and costly occupational health problem.

<summary>Discussion: Why Different Heights for Different Tasks?</summary>

**Precision Work (100-110 cm):**
- Requires close visual inspection
- Hands need to be at or above eye level
- Examples: Electronics assembly, inspection, watchmaking

**Light Assembly (85-95 cm):**
- General manipulation tasks
- Hands at about elbow height
- Examples: Packaging, general assembly, sorting

**Heavy Work (70-85 cm):**
- Requires pushing, pressing, or lifting
- Lower height allows use of body weight
- Examples: Packing boxes, pressing operations, heavy assembly

**Key Principle:** The work surface height should allow the worker to maintain **neutral posture** while performing the specific task.

<summary>Practice Problem: REBA Assessment</summary>

**Scenario:** A worker is performing a task with the following postures:

- **Trunk:** 30° forward flexion, twisted
- **Neck:** 15° flexion
- **Legs:** Weight on one leg
- **Upper Arm:** 60° flexion, shoulder raised
- **Lower Arm:** 80° flexion
- **Wrist:** Neutral
- **Load:** 8 kg carried
- **Coupling:** Fair grip (handles exist but not ideal)
- **Activity:** Repeated small range actions

**Calculate the REBA score and determine the action level.**

**Solution:**
```
Trunk: 3 + 1 (twisted) = 4
Neck: 1 (0-20° flexion)
Legs: 2 (weight on one leg)
Table A = 5
Load/Force = 1 (5-10kg)
Score A = 6

Upper Arm: 3 + 1 (raised) = 4
Lower Arm: 1 (60-100°)
Wrist: 1 (neutral)
Table B = 4
Coupling = 1 (fair)
Score B = 5

Table C (Score A=6, Score B=5) = 8
Activity = +1 (repeated actions)
REBA Score = 9

Risk Level: HIGH - Action necessary soon
```

### NIOSH Lifting Equation

The **NIOSH Lifting Equation** calculates a **Recommended Weight Limit (RWL)** for lifting tasks.

$$RWL = LC \times HM \times VM \times DM \times AM \times FM \times CM$$

Where:

## Ergonomics in Automated Manufacturing

Industrial automation inherently involves the mechanization of processes traditionally carried out by human operators. In the automation design phase, engineers must strike a balance between mechanization and the necessary human interaction with these systems.

### Human-Automation Interaction Points

## Review Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: What are the seven ergonomic risk factors, and which two are most commonly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome?</summary>

The seven ergonomic risk factors are:
1. Awkward Postures
2. Repetition
3. Force
4. Static Positions
5. Contact Stress
6. Vibration
7. Environmental Factors

**Carpal tunnel syndrome** is most commonly associated with:
- **Repetition** - Repeated wrist movements compress the median nerve
- **Force** - Forceful gripping increases pressure in the carpal tunnel
- Also contributing: awkward wrist postures and vibration

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: A worker performs a task 8 times per minute for a 4-hour shift. The cycle time is 7.5 seconds. Is this considered high repetition? Why?</summary>

**Analysis:**
- Cycle time: 7.5 seconds (< 15 seconds threshold)
- Repetitions per hour: 8 × 60 = 480 (> 240 threshold)

**Yes, this is HIGH repetition** because:
1. Cycle time is less than 15 seconds
2. Repetitions exceed 240 per hour

**Risk Level:** High - Immediate intervention needed

**Recommended actions:**
- Job rotation with different tasks
- Automation of repetitive elements
- Micro-breaks every 20-30 minutes
- Workstation redesign to reduce cycle elements

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Explain why ergonomic design should accommodate the 5th to 95th percentile of the population rather than designing for the "average" person.</summary>

**Designing for the average excludes most people:**
- The "average" person in ALL dimensions doesn't exist
- A person may be average height but have long arms or short legs
- Designing for only the 50th percentile fits only about 50% of users

**The 5th-95th percentile range:**
- Accommodates 90% of the population
- Addresses both small and large users
- Provides adjustability rather than fixed dimensions

**Application rules:**
- **Clearances** (overhead, legroom): Design for 95th percentile (largest)
- **Reach distances**: Design for 5th percentile (smallest)
- **Work surfaces**: Make adjustable to accommodate range

**Example:** A fixed workstation at 95cm height:
- Too high for 5th percentile female (elbow at ~93cm)
- Too low for 95th percentile male (elbow at ~117cm)
- Adjustable range of 85-115cm accommodates both

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: Calculate the NIOSH Lifting Index for the following task and determine if intervention is needed.</summary>

**Task Parameters:**
- Horizontal distance (H): 35 cm
- Vertical height (V): 80 cm
- Travel distance (D): 50 cm
- Asymmetry (A): 0° (symmetric lift)
- Frequency: 4 lifts/minute for 1 hour
- Coupling: Good (handles)
- Actual load: 18 kg

**Solution:**
```
LC = 23 kg
HM = 25/35 = 0.714
VM = 1 - 0.003|80-75| = 0.985
DM = 0.82 + 4.5/50 = 0.91
AM = 1 - 0.0032(0) = 1.0
FM = 0.75 (4/min, 1 hour, V>75cm, from table)
CM = 1.0 (good coupling)

RWL = 23 × 0.714 × 0.985 × 0.91 × 1.0 × 0.75 × 1.0
RWL = 11.0 kg

LI = 18 / 11.0 = 1.64

Risk Level: MODERATE (1.0 < LI < 2.0)
Action: Some workers may be at risk - consider changes
```

**Recommendations:**
- Reduce horizontal distance (bring load closer)
- Reduce lifting frequency
- Use mechanical assist for loads >12 kg

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: What are three advantages of AI-powered ergonomic assessment over traditional methods?</summary>

**1. Scale and Coverage:**
- Traditional: 5-10 assessments per day by trained ergonomist
- AI: Hundreds or thousands of assessments simultaneously
- Can monitor entire facility continuously

**2. Consistency and Objectivity:**
- Traditional: Inter-rater reliability issues; different assessors may score differently
- AI: Consistent scoring algorithm applied uniformly
- Removes subjective interpretation

**3. Real-time Feedback:**
- Traditional: Assessment completed, report generated days/weeks later
- AI: Immediate scoring and alerts
- Can provide real-time coaching to workers

**Additional advantages:**
- Lower cost per assessment
- Non-disruptive (workers not aware of assessment)
- Longitudinal tracking of posture patterns
- Data for predictive analytics

## Introduction to PFMEA

### What is PFMEA?

**Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA)** is a systematic, proactive method for evaluating a manufacturing or business process to identify where and how it might fail, and to assess the relative impact of different failures. The goal is to identify and prioritize actions that will prevent defects before they occur.

### DFMEA vs. PFMEA

Two main types of FMEA are used in product development:

<details>
<summary>Question: When should PFMEA be conducted?</summary>

**Ideal Timing for PFMEA:**

1. **New Process Development:** Before production begins, during process design
2. **New Product Introduction:** When a new product will use existing processes
3. **Process Changes:** Whenever significant changes are made to equipment, methods, or materials
4. **Quality Issues:** When field failures or customer complaints indicate process problems
5. **Regular Review:** Periodically (annually) to ensure continued relevance

**Key Principle:** The earlier PFMEA is conducted, the lower the cost of implementing improvements. Changes during design cost 10x less than changes during production, and 100x less than changes after customer delivery.

## PFMEA Fundamentals

### Core Objectives

The fundamental objective of PFMEA is **prevention over detection** — identifying and eliminating potential failures before they occur, rather than finding defects after production.

```{r pfmea-objectives, echo=FALSE}
objectives <- tibble(
  `Objective` = c("**Identify Failure Modes**", "**Assess Risk**", "**Prioritize Actions**",
                  "**Document Knowledge**", "**Drive Improvement**"),
  `Description` = c("Systematically identify all ways the process can fail",
                    "Evaluate severity, likelihood, and detectability of each failure",
                    "Focus resources on highest-risk failure modes",
                    "Capture institutional knowledge in a structured format",
                    "Implement and verify effectiveness of countermeasures"),
  `Outcome` = c("Comprehensive list of potential problems",
                "Quantified risk scores (RPN or AP)",
                "Action plan focused on critical issues",
                "Living document for continuous improvement",
                "Measurable reduction in process risk")
)

objectives %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Core Objectives of PFMEA") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#27AE60", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "12em")
```

### The PFMEA Team

PFMEA is most effective when conducted by a **cross-functional team**. No single person has all the knowledge needed to identify every potential failure.

```{r pfmea-team, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="PFMEA Cross-Functional Team", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
team <- data.frame(
  role = c("Process\nEngineer", "Quality\nEngineer", "Production\nSupervisor",
           "Maintenance\nTech", "Design\nEngineer", "Supplier\nRep"),
  contribution = c("Process knowledge\nEquipment specs", "Historical data\nControl methods",
                   "Day-to-day issues\nOperator insights", "Equipment failures\nMaintenance history",
                   "Design intent\nTolerances", "Material properties\nSupply issues"),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3),
  y = c(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1)
)

ggplot(team, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_tile(width = 0.9, height = 0.8, fill = "#3498DB", color = "white", size = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = role), color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 3.5,
            vjust = -0.3, lineheight = 0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = contribution), color = "white", size = 2.5,
            vjust = 1.5, lineheight = 0.8) +
  # Facilitator in center
  annotate("point", x = 2, y = 1.5, size = 25, color = "#E74C3C") +
  annotate("text", x = 2, y = 1.5, label = "PFMEA\nFacilitator",
           color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 3.5, lineheight = 0.9) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "PFMEA Team Composition",
       subtitle = "Each member brings unique knowledge and perspective") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10)) +
  xlim(0.3, 3.7) + ylim(0.3, 2.7)
```

<details>
<summary>Question: Why is a cross-functional team essential?</summary>

**A cross-functional team is essential because:**

1. **Diverse Knowledge:** No single person understands all aspects of the process
2. **Different Perspectives:** Quality sees defects, production sees constraints, maintenance sees failures
3. **Buy-in:** People support what they help create
4. **Historical Knowledge:** Operators often know about problems never formally documented
5. **System Thinking:** Process interactions are visible when multiple functions participate

**Common Mistake:** Having one engineer complete PFMEA alone as a "paperwork exercise." This misses critical failure modes and produces an ineffective document.

**Best Practice:** Minimum 4-6 team members, including at least one person with hands-on process experience.

</details>

### Key Terminology

Understanding PFMEA terminology is essential for effective analysis:

```{r pfmea-terminology, echo=FALSE}
terminology <- tibble(
  `Term` = c("**Process Function**", "**Failure Mode**", "**Failure Effect**",
             "**Severity (S)**", "**Failure Cause**", "**Occurrence (O)**",
             "**Current Controls**", "**Detection (D)**", "**RPN**", "**Action Priority (AP)**"),
  `Definition` = c("What the process step is supposed to do",
                   "How the process can fail to perform its function",
                   "The consequence of the failure on the customer or next operation",
                   "Rating (1-10) of how serious the failure effect is",
                   "Why the failure mode might occur",
                   "Rating (1-10) of how likely the cause is to happen",
                   "What currently prevents the cause or detects the failure",
                   "Rating (1-10) of how likely current controls will detect the failure",
                   "Risk Priority Number = S × O × D",
                   "Alternative prioritization method (AIAG-VDA)"),
  `Example` = c("'Drill hole to 10mm ± 0.1mm'",
                "Hole diameter undersize, oversize, off-location",
                "Part rejected at assembly, field failure",
                "10 = safety hazard, 1 = no effect",
                "Drill bit wear, incorrect feed rate",
                "10 = very high, 1 = remote",
                "In-process gauge, SPC chart",
                "10 = no detection, 1 = certain detection",
                "Range: 1 to 1000",
                "High, Medium, Low")
)

terminology %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "PFMEA Key Terminology") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered", "responsive"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#8E44AD", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "12em")
```

### The PFMEA Form

The PFMEA is documented in a structured form. Here is a simplified template:

```{r pfmea-form, echo=FALSE}
form_template <- tibble(
  `Process Step` = c("Example:", ""),
  `Function` = c("Drill hole", ""),
  `Failure Mode` = c("Hole undersize", ""),
  `Effect` = c("Assembly interference", ""),
  `S` = c("7", ""),
  `Cause` = c("Drill wear", ""),
  `O` = c("5", ""),
  `Current Controls` = c("Visual inspection", ""),
  `D` = c("6", ""),
  `RPN` = c("210", ""),
  `Action` = c("Add in-process gauge", "")
)

form_template %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "PFMEA Form Template (Simplified)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("bordered", "responsive"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center", font_size = 10) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#2C3E50", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(1, background = "#D5F5E3")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The PFMEA Methodology: 10 Steps

PFMEA follows a systematic 10-step methodology. Each step builds on the previous one.

```{r pfmea-steps-overview, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The 10-Step PFMEA Methodology", fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
steps <- data.frame(
  step = 1:10,
  name = c("Define Scope", "Map Process", "Identify Failures",
           "Analyze Effects", "Rate Severity", "Identify Causes",
           "Rate Occurrence", "Assess Controls", "Calculate RPN",
           "Take Action"),
  phase = c("Plan", "Plan", "Analyze", "Analyze", "Analyze",
            "Analyze", "Analyze", "Analyze", "Prioritize", "Improve"),
  y = c(5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2),
  x = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1.5, 2.5)
)

ggplot(steps, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = phase), width = 0.9, height = 0.8, color = "white", size = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(step, ". ", name)), color = "white",
            fontface = "bold", size = 3, lineheight = 0.9) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Plan" = "#3498DB", "Analyze" = "#F39C12",
                               "Prioritize" = "#E74C3C", "Improve" = "#27AE60")) +
  # Arrows showing flow
  annotate("segment", x = 1, xend = 2, y = 4.5, yend = 4.5,
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "cm")), color = "#2C3E50") +
  annotate("segment", x = 2, xend = 1, y = 4.1, yend = 3.5,
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "cm")), color = "#2C3E50") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "The 10-Step PFMEA Process",
       subtitle = "A systematic approach to process risk analysis") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10),
        legend.position = "bottom") +
  xlim(0.3, 3.7) + ylim(1.3, 5.7)
```

### Step 1: Define Scope and Process Boundaries

Before starting the analysis, clearly define what is included and excluded.

```{r step1-scope, echo=FALSE}
scope_elements <- tibble(
  `Element` = c("**Process Name**", "**Start Boundary**", "**End Boundary**",
                "**Included Operations**", "**Excluded Operations**", "**Key Assumptions**"),
  `Description` = c("Clear name identifying the process",
                    "Where does our analysis begin?",
                    "Where does our analysis end?",
                    "All operations within scope",
                    "Operations analyzed separately or by others",
                    "Conditions assumed to be true"),
  `Example: Injection Molding` = c("Plastic Part Injection Molding",
                                    "Raw material loading into hopper",
                                    "Part removed from mold, ready for packaging",
                                    "Material prep, injection, cooling, ejection, inspection",
                                    "Mold design (covered by DFMEA), packaging",
                                    "Material meets incoming spec, mold is validated")
)

scope_elements %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Step 1: Defining PFMEA Scope") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#3498DB", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "12em")
```

### Step 2: Process Mapping and Identifying Functions

Create a detailed process flow diagram and identify the function of each step.

```{r step2-process-map, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Example: Injection Molding Process Flow", fig.width=10, fig.height=4}

### Step 3: Identifying Potential Failure Modes

For each process function, ask: **"How can this step fail to perform its intended function?"**

```{r step3-failure-modes, echo=FALSE}
failure_modes <- tibble(
  `Process Function` = c("Load correct material", "Load correct material", "Load correct material",
                         "Melt to specification temperature", "Melt to specification temperature",
                         "Fill mold completely", "Fill mold completely", "Fill mold completely"),
  `Potential Failure Mode` = c("Wrong material loaded", "Material contaminated", "Insufficient material",
                                "Temperature too low", "Temperature too high",
                                "Short shot (incomplete fill)", "Flash (overfill)", "Air entrapment"),
  `Category` = c("Wrong item", "Degraded item", "Missing item",
                 "Below specification", "Above specification",
                 "Incomplete operation", "Excessive operation", "Unintended result")
)

failure_modes %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Step 3: Identifying Failure Modes") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#F39C12", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "15em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "10em", background = "#FEF9E7")
```

**Common failure mode categories:**
- **No operation** (step doesn't happen)
- **Partial operation** (incomplete)
- **Degraded operation** (below standard)
- **Excessive operation** (too much)
- **Wrong operation** (incorrect action)
- **Intermittent operation** (inconsistent)

<details>
<summary>Interactive Exercise: Identify Failure Modes</summary>

**Process Step:** Heat treat steel parts at 850°C for 2 hours

**Function:** Achieve required hardness (58-62 HRC)

**Identify at least 5 potential failure modes:**

**Answers:**
1. Temperature too low → Parts soft (below hardness spec)
2. Temperature too high → Parts brittle/cracked
3. Time too short → Incomplete hardening
4. Time too long → Over-hardening, distortion
5. Uneven heating → Inconsistent hardness across part
6. Wrong atmosphere → Surface decarburization
7. Quench delay too long → Soft spots

</details>

### Step 4: Analyzing Failure Effects

For each failure mode, determine: **"What is the consequence if this failure occurs?"**

Consider effects at multiple levels:
1. **Local effect:** Impact on immediate operation
2. **Next operation effect:** Impact on downstream process
3. **End customer effect:** Impact on final user

```{r step4-effects, echo=FALSE}
effects <- tibble(
  `Failure Mode` = c("Short shot", "Short shot", "Short shot",
                     "Flash", "Flash", "Flash"),
  `Effect Level` = c("Local", "Next Operation", "End Customer",
                     "Local", "Next Operation", "End Customer"),
  `Effect Description` = c("Part is incomplete/missing features",
                           "Part rejected at inspection, line stoppage",
                           "If shipped: product malfunction, safety hazard",
                           "Excess material on part edges",
                           "Secondary trimming required, increased cycle time",
                           "If shipped: poor fit, appearance defect")
)

effects %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Step 4: Analyzing Effects at Multiple Levels") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#E74C3C", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(c(3, 6), background = "#FADBD8")
```

### Step 5: Determining Severity Ratings

**Severity (S)** rates the seriousness of the effect on a scale of 1-10.

```{r severity-scale, echo=FALSE}
severity <- tibble(
  `Rating` = 10:1,
  `Effect` = c("Hazardous - without warning",
               "Hazardous - with warning",
               "Very High",
               "High",
               "Moderate",
               "Low",
               "Very Low",
               "Minor",
               "Very Minor",
               "None"),
  `Criteria` = c("Safety hazard; noncompliance with regulations; no warning",
                 "Safety hazard; noncompliance with regulations; with warning",
                 "Product inoperable; loss of primary function",
                 "Product operable but at reduced performance",
                 "Product operable; comfort/convenience affected; noticeable",
                 "Product operable; reduced comfort; noticed by average customer",
                 "Product operable; slightly reduced comfort; noticed by discriminating customer",
                 "Fit/finish nonconforming; noticed by discriminating customer",
                 "Fit/finish nonconforming; noticed only by trained observer",
                 "No discernible effect"),
  `Example` = c("Brake failure without warning",
                "Airbag warning light before failure",
                "Engine won't start",
                "Engine runs rough, reduced power",
                "Wind noise, A/C takes longer to cool",
                "Door handle feels loose",
                "Slight paint imperfection",
                "Panel gap slightly uneven",
                "Under-hood label crooked",
                "No effect observable")
)

severity %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Severity Rating Scale (S)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#E74C3C", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(1:2, background = "#FADBD8", bold = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(3:4, background = "#FEF9E7") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "5em")
```

> **Important:** Severity is determined by the **effect**, not the failure mode. Severity can only be reduced by changing the design — process changes typically cannot reduce severity.

### Step 6: Identifying Potential Causes

For each failure mode, identify all possible causes: **"Why might this failure occur?"**

```{r step6-causes, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Fishbone Diagram: Causes of Short Shot", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14)) +
  ylim(0.3, 5.7)
```

### Step 7: Rating Occurrence

**Occurrence (O)** rates the likelihood that the cause will occur on a scale of 1-10.

```{r occurrence-scale, echo=FALSE}
occurrence <- tibble(
  `Rating` = 10:1,
  `Likelihood` = c("Very High", "Very High", "High", "High",
                   "Moderate", "Moderate", "Low", "Low", "Remote", "Remote"),
  `Criteria` = c("Failure is almost inevitable",
                 "Failures occur very frequently",
                 "Failures occur frequently",
                 "Failures occur on regular basis",
                 "Occasional failures",
                 "Occasional failures expected",
                 "Relatively few failures",
                 "Few failures",
                 "Failure unlikely",
                 "Failure nearly impossible"),
  `Approximate Rate` = c("≥100 per 1000 (≥10%)",
                         "50 per 1000 (5%)",
                         "20 per 1000 (2%)",
                         "10 per 1000 (1%)",
                         "5 per 1000 (0.5%)",
                         "2 per 1000 (0.2%)",
                         "1 per 1000 (0.1%)",
                         "0.5 per 1000 (500 ppm)",
                         "0.1 per 1000 (100 ppm)",
                         "≤0.01 per 1000 (≤10 ppm)"),
  `Cpk Equivalent` = c("< 0.33", "≥ 0.33", "≥ 0.51", "≥ 0.67",
                       "≥ 0.83", "≥ 1.00", "≥ 1.17", "≥ 1.33", "≥ 1.50", "≥ 1.67")
)

occurrence %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Occurrence Rating Scale (O)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#F39C12", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(1:2, background = "#FADBD8") %>%
  row_spec(3:4, background = "#FEF9E7") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "5em")
```

### Step 8: Current Controls and Detection Ratings

Identify current controls and rate their ability to detect the failure or cause.

**Types of Process Controls:**

```{r control-types, echo=FALSE}
controls <- tibble(
  `Control Type` = c("**Prevention Controls**", "**Detection Controls**"),
  `Purpose` = c("Prevent the cause from occurring",
                "Detect the failure mode or cause after it occurs"),
  `Examples` = c("Error-proofing (poka-yoke), interlocks, maintenance programs",
                 "Inspection, testing, gauging, SPC monitoring"),
  `Impact on PFMEA` = c("Reduces Occurrence rating",
                        "Reduces Detection rating")
)

controls %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Types of Process Controls") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#27AE60", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "12em")
```

**Detection Rating Scale:**

```{r detection-scale, echo=FALSE}
detection <- tibble(
  `Rating` = 10:1,
  `Detection` = c("Absolute Uncertainty", "Very Remote", "Remote", "Very Low",
                  "Low", "Moderate", "Moderately High", "High", "Very High", "Almost Certain"),
  `Criteria` = c("No current control; cannot detect or is not analyzed",
                 "Control will probably not detect",
                 "Control has poor chance of detection",
                 "Control has low chance of detection",
                 "Control may detect",
                 "Control has moderate chance of detection",
                 "Control has moderately high chance of detection",
                 "Control has high chance of detection",
                 "Control almost certain to detect",
                 "Control will detect; error-proofed"),
  `Example Control` = c("No inspection planned",
                        "Indirect measurement only",
                        "Visual inspection of hidden feature",
                        "Manual 100% visual inspection",
                        "Variable gauging after operation",
                        "SPC charting",
                        "In-station gauging with feedback",
                        "Automated 100% gauging",
                        "Multiple independent automated checks",
                        "Error-proofing prevents defect creation")
)

detection %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Detection Rating Scale (D)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#9B59B6", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(1:3, background = "#FADBD8") %>%
  row_spec(9:10, background = "#D5F5E3") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "5em")
```

> **Important:** Detection ratings are often **harder to reduce** than occurrence ratings. Adding inspection doesn't prevent defects — it only catches them. Prevention is always better than detection.

<details>
<summary>Question: Why are detection ratings often harder to improve?</summary>

**Detection ratings are harder to reduce because:**

1. **Detection doesn't prevent:** The defect has already been made; you're just trying to find it
2. **Human inspection is unreliable:** Typical effectiveness is only 80-85% for visual inspection
3. **100% inspection is expensive:** Automated inspection requires significant investment
4. **Some defects are hard to detect:** Internal defects, intermittent problems, latent failures
5. **Sampling has limitations:** Even good sampling plans miss some defects

**Better approach:** Focus on reducing occurrence through:
- Error-proofing (poka-yoke)
- Process capability improvement
- Preventive maintenance
- Better training

</details>

### Step 9: Calculating RPN and Prioritization

The **Risk Priority Number (RPN)** combines all three ratings:

$$\text{RPN} = \text{Severity (S)} \times \text{Occurrence (O)} \times \text{Detection (D)}$$

```{r rpn-calculation, echo=TRUE}
# Example RPN Calculations

# Failure Mode 1: Short shot
S1 <- 7    # Severity: Product inoperable (assembly)
O1 <- 5    # Occurrence: Occasional
D1 <- 6    # Detection: Moderate (visual inspection)

RPN1 <- S1 * O1 * D1
cat("Short shot RPN:", RPN1, "\n")

# Failure Mode 2: Flash
S2 <- 4    # Severity: Appearance issue
O2 <- 6    # Occurrence: Regular
D2 <- 3    # Detection: High (easy to see)

RPN2 <- S2 * O2 * D2
cat("Flash RPN:", RPN2, "\n")

# Failure Mode 3: Contamination
S3 <- 9    # Severity: Safety concern (medical device)
O3 <- 3    # Occurrence: Low
D3 <- 7    # Detection: Low (internal contamination)

RPN3 <- S3 * O3 * D3
cat("Contamination RPN:", RPN3, "\n")

# Comparison
cat("\n--- Priority Order by RPN ---\n")
cat("1. Short shot (RPN =", RPN1, ")\n")
cat("2. Contamination (RPN =", RPN3, ")\n")
cat("3. Flash (RPN =", RPN2, ")\n")
```

**RPN Action Thresholds (Traditional):**

```{r rpn-thresholds, echo=FALSE}
thresholds <- tibble(
  `RPN Range` = c("1-50", "51-100", "101-200", "201-500", "501-1000"),
  `Risk Level` = c("Low", "Moderate", "Significant", "High", "Critical"),
  `Action Required` = c("Monitor; no immediate action",
                        "Consider action if resources available",
                        "Action required within planning cycle",
                        "Immediate action required",
                        "Stop production; immediate corrective action")
)

thresholds %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "RPN Action Thresholds") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = FALSE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#E74C3C", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(1, background = "#D5F5E3") %>%
  row_spec(2, background = "#D5F5E3") %>%
  row_spec(3, background = "#FEF9E7") %>%
  row_spec(4, background = "#FADBD8") %>%
  row_spec(5, background = "#E74C3C", color = "white")
```

<details>
<summary>Interactive Exercise: Calculate RPN</summary>

**Calculate the RPN for each failure mode and rank them:**

| Failure Mode | Severity | Occurrence | Detection | RPN |
|--------------|----------|------------|-----------|-----|
| A: Dimension out of spec | 6 | 4 | 5 | ? |
| B: Surface scratch | 3 | 7 | 2 | ? |
| C: Missing component | 8 | 2 | 8 | ? |
| D: Wrong material | 9 | 3 | 6 | ? |

**Answers:**
- A: 6 × 4 × 5 = **120**
- B: 3 × 7 × 2 = **42**
- C: 8 × 2 × 8 = **128**
- D: 9 × 3 × 6 = **162**

**Priority Order:** D (162) > C (128) > A (120) > B (42)

**Question:** Should we always address the highest RPN first? See limitations discussion below.

</details>

### Limitations of RPN

RPN has known limitations that must be understood:

```{r rpn-limitations, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="RPN Limitation Example", fig.width=9, fig.height=5}
# Show how different S-O-D combinations give same RPN
examples <- data.frame(
  case = c("Case A", "Case B", "Case C"),

**Key RPN Limitations:**

1. **Same RPN, different risk:** 10×1×4 = 40, but 2×10×2 = 40
2. **Severity often overlooked:** High severity should always trigger action
3. **Arbitrary thresholds:** Why is 100 the magic number?
4. **Non-linear scale:** Difference between 2 and 3 is not same as 8 and 9

### Action Priority (AP) Method — AIAG-VDA Alternative

The 2019 AIAG-VDA FMEA Handbook introduced the **Action Priority (AP)** method as an alternative to RPN.

```{r ap-method, echo=FALSE}

  `Criteria` = c("Severity = 9 or 10 (any O, any D)",
                 "Severity = 8 AND Occurrence ≥ 4",
                 "Severity = 7 AND Occurrence ≥ 5",
                 "Severity = 5-6 AND Occurrence ≥ 6 AND Detection ≥ 5",
                 "All other combinations"),
  `Action Required` = c("Must take action to improve prevention/detection",
                        "Must take action",

For high-priority items, develop specific recommended actions.

<summary>Interactive Exercise: Create a PFMEA</summary>

**Create a simple PFMEA for a coffee brewing process in a commercial setting.**

**Process Steps:**
1. Fill water reservoir
2. Load coffee grounds
3. Brew coffee
4. Dispense into cup

**Identify at least 4 failure modes with S, O, D ratings and RPN.**

**Example Answer:**

| Step | Failure Mode | Effect | S | Cause | O | Control | D | RPN |
|------|--------------|--------|---|-------|---|---------|---|-----|
| 1. Fill water | Wrong water level | Weak/strong coffee | 4 | No level indicator | 5 | Visual check | 5 | 100 |
| 2. Load grounds | Wrong amount | Weak/strong coffee | 4 | No measuring | 6 | Visual check | 6 | 144 |
| 3. Brew | Temperature too low | Under-extracted | 6 | Heating element worn | 3 | Temp display | 4 | 72 |
| 4. Dispense | Overflow | Burn hazard, mess | 8 | Cup sensor failure | 2 | Cup sensor | 4 | 64 |

**Priority:** Wrong amount (144) > Water level (100) > Temperature (72) > Overflow (64)

## Case Study: Preventing a Major Quality Issue

### Background

**Company:** Automotive brake component manufacturer

**Product:** Brake caliper mounting bracket

**Situation:** New manufacturing process being implemented for a high-volume contract

### PFMEA Analysis

During the PFMEA session, the team identified a critical failure mode:

```{r case-study-finding, echo=FALSE}
case_finding <- tibble(
  `Element` = c("Process Step", "Function", "Failure Mode", "Effect", "Severity",
                "Cause", "Occurrence", "Current Control", "Detection", "RPN"),

```

### Actions Taken

Based on the PFMEA, the team implemented:

1. **In-process gauging:** Automated measurement after every part (D: 5 → 2)
2. **Fixture monitoring:** Temperature compensation and wear tracking (O: 4 → 2)
3. **Enhanced fixture design:** Carbide wear surfaces (O: 4 → 2)

### Results

- **Zero field failures** related to hole spacing after 18 months of production
- **Estimated avoided cost:** $2.4 million in potential recall and warranty
- **Investment:** $85,000 for gauging and fixture upgrades
- **ROI:** 28:1

> **Key Lesson:** The PFMEA investment of $85,000 prevented a potential $2.4 million problem. This is the power of proactive risk management.

## Review Questions

### Conceptual Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: What is the difference between a failure mode and a failure effect?</summary>

**Failure Mode:** How the process fails to perform its intended function
- Example: "Hole drilled undersize"
- Example: "Temperature too low"
- Example: "Missing component"

**Failure Effect:** The consequence of the failure mode
- Example: "Part rejected at assembly" (effect of undersize hole)
- Example: "Product not properly cured" (effect of low temperature)
- Example: "Product doesn't function" (effect of missing component)

**Key Relationship:** One failure mode can have multiple effects at different levels (local, downstream, customer).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Why should PFMEA be conducted by a cross-functional team?</summary>

**Reasons for Cross-Functional Team:**

1. **Diverse expertise:** No single person understands all aspects
2. **Multiple perspectives:** Quality sees defects differently than production
3. **Historical knowledge:** Operators know undocumented problems
4. **Buy-in:** People support what they help create
5. **System thinking:** Process interactions become visible
6. **Better solutions:** Different functions propose different improvements

**Typical team composition:**
- Process Engineer (owner)
- Quality Engineer
- Production Supervisor/Operator
- Maintenance Technician
- Design Engineer
- Supplier Representative (when applicable)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Explain why detection ratings are often harder to reduce than occurrence ratings.</summary>

**Detection is harder to reduce because:**

1. **Detection doesn't prevent:** Defect already exists; just trying to find it
2. **Human inspection is unreliable:** 80-85% effectiveness typical
3. **100% inspection is expensive:** Requires automation investment
4. **Some defects are hidden:** Internal defects, intermittent failures
5. **Sampling limitations:** Cannot catch all defects with sampling

**Better approach:** Focus on occurrence reduction:
- Error-proofing (poka-yoke)
- Process capability improvement
- Preventive maintenance
- Better training

**Example:** Reducing drill wear (occurrence) is more effective than adding more inspection (detection).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: At what point in process development should PFMEA ideally be conducted?</summary>

**Ideal Timing:** During process design, before production begins

**Why early is better:**
- Changes cost 1x during design
- Changes cost 10x during production
- Changes cost 100x after customer delivery

**PFMEA Timing Points:**
1. **New process development:** Before equipment is ordered
2. **New product introduction:** During process planning
3. **Process changes:** Before implementing changes
4. **Quality issues:** When problems indicate process risk
5. **Regular review:** Annually at minimum

**Key Principle:** The earlier PFMEA is conducted, the more opportunity exists to design out failures rather than inspect them out.

</details>

### Calculation Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 5: Given S=8, O=6, D=4, calculate RPN. If improved controls reduce detection to 2, what is the new RPN?</summary>

**Initial Calculation:**
```
RPN = S × O × D
RPN = 8 × 6 × 4 = 192
```

**After Detection Improvement:**
```
New RPN = 8 × 6 × 2 = 96
```

**Analysis:**
- Original RPN: 192 (Significant risk, action required)
- New RPN: 96 (Moderate risk)
- Reduction: 50%

**Note:** Severity (8) remains unchanged because it's determined by the effect, not by process controls. Only occurrence and detection can be reduced through process improvements.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 6: Two failure modes have RPNs of 120 and 150. Should the higher RPN always be addressed first?</summary>

**Answer:** Not necessarily!

**Consider the following scenarios:**

**Scenario A:**
- Failure Mode 1: RPN = 150 (S=3, O=10, D=5) — Minor cosmetic issue
- Failure Mode 2: RPN = 120 (S=10, O=3, D=4) — Safety hazard

**Priority:** Address Failure Mode 2 first despite lower RPN because:
- Severity 10 indicates safety hazard
- High-severity items should always be addressed regardless of RPN
- The AP (Action Priority) method would classify this as HIGH priority

**When to prioritize lower RPN:**
- Higher severity (especially 9-10)
- Regulatory or safety implications
- Customer-critical characteristic
- Easier/faster to implement

**Key Lesson:** RPN is a prioritization tool, not the only decision criterion. Use engineering judgment.

</details>

### Application Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 7: For a metal stamping operation, identify at least five potential failure modes and their likely effects.</summary>

**Metal Stamping PFMEA:**

| # | Failure Mode | Effect |
|---|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Part not fully formed | Dimensional rejection, functional failure |
| 2 | Burrs on edges | Injury hazard, assembly interference |
| 3 | Cracks/splits | Structural failure, scrap |
| 4 | Wrong material thickness | Dimensional/strength issues |
| 5 | Mislocated features | Assembly issues, rejection |
| 6 | Surface scratches | Appearance rejection, corrosion initiation |
| 7 | Springback out of tolerance | Dimensional rejection |
| 8 | Die mark/impression | Appearance defect |

**Potential Causes for "Part not fully formed":**
- Insufficient press tonnage
- Die wear
- Material too hard
- Lubrication insufficient
- Press speed too fast

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 8: A process has RPN of 240 (S=8, O=6, D=5). Propose three improvement strategies and calculate resulting RPN.</summary>

**Current State:** S=8, O=6, D=5, RPN=240

**Strategy 1: Improve Detection**
- Add automated inspection (100% gauging)
- New D = 2
- New RPN = 8 × 6 × 2 = **96** (60% reduction)

**Strategy 2: Improve Occurrence**
- Add error-proofing (poka-yoke) to prevent cause
- New O = 2
- New RPN = 8 × 2 × 5 = **80** (67% reduction)

**Strategy 3: Combined Approach**
- Error-proofing (O → 3) + Better detection (D → 3)
- New RPN = 8 × 3 × 3 = **72** (70% reduction)

**Recommendation:** Strategy 2 (error-proofing) is typically preferred because:
- Prevents defects from occurring
- More sustainable long-term
- Reduces inspection costs
- Better for customer confidence

</details>

### Critical Thinking Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 9: Discuss the limitations of using RPN as the sole prioritization method.</summary>

**RPN Limitations:**

1. **Equal weighting problem:**
   - 10×1×4 = 40 (safety hazard, rare)
   - 2×10×2 = 40 (minor, frequent)
   - Same RPN, very different risk!

2. **Severity often overlooked:**
   - High-severity items (9-10) should always be addressed
   - RPN can hide safety-critical issues

3. **Non-linear scales:**
   - Difference between S=2 and S=3 is not same as S=8 and S=9
   - Multiplication assumes linear relationship

4. **Arbitrary thresholds:**
   - Why is RPN=100 the "action" threshold?
   - No scientific basis for specific cutoffs

5. **Gaming the system:**
   - Teams may manipulate ratings to avoid action
   - Subjectivity in ratings

**Better Approaches:**
- Action Priority (AP) method
- Always act on S ≥ 9 regardless of RPN
- Consider multiple criteria (cost, feasibility, timing)
- Use risk matrix visualization

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 10: How would you handle a situation where team members disagree on severity ratings?</summary>

**Approach to Rating Disagreements:**

**1. Clarify the failure effect:**
- Ensure everyone understands the same effect
- Be specific about which customer sees which impact

**2. Reference the rating criteria:**
- Use the standardized scale consistently
- Point to specific criteria, not opinions

**3. Consider worst-case scenario:**
- PFMEA should consider worst reasonable case
- "Could this effect happen?" vs "Will it happen?"

**4. Gather data:**
- Review historical data if available
- What have similar failures caused in the past?

**5. When in doubt, go higher:**
- Conservative approach is appropriate for safety
- Can always reduce later with evidence

**6. Document the discussion:**
- Record the rationale for the rating
- Note if there was disagreement and why decision was made

**7. Get external input:**
- Bring in customer perspective if needed
- Consult subject matter experts

**Final Rule:** If a safety or regulatory issue is possible, severity should be 9 or 10 regardless of probability.

## Introduction to SPC

### What is Statistical Process Control?

**Statistical Process Control (SPC)** is a method of quality control that uses statistical methods to monitor and control a process. It helps ensure that the process operates at its full potential to produce conforming product.

## Understanding Variation

**All processes exhibit variation.** No two products are ever exactly identical. The key insight of SPC is that variation comes from two fundamentally different sources, and we must respond to them differently.

### Common Cause vs. Special Cause Variation

```{r variation-types, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Two Types of Variation", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Generate example data
set.seed(123)
n <- 50
common_cause <- rnorm(n, mean = 50, sd = 2)
special_cause <- c(rnorm(35, mean = 50, sd = 2), rnorm(15, mean = 54, sd = 2))

df <- data.frame(
  sample = rep(1:n, 2),
  value = c(common_cause, special_cause),
  type = rep(c("Common Cause Only", "Common + Special Cause"), each = n)

    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 11)
  )
```

```{r variation-comparison, echo=FALSE}
variation_types <- tibble(
  `Characteristic` = c("**Other Names**", "**Source**", "**Pattern**", "**Predictability**",
                       "**Examples**", "**Action Required**", "**Who Acts**"),

)

### The Two Mistakes in Process Control

Understanding variation prevents two costly mistakes:

```{r two-mistakes, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The Two Fundamental Mistakes", fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
ggplot() +
  # Mistake 1
  annotate("rect", xmin = 0, xmax = 4.5, ymin = 0, ymax = 3, fill = "#E74C3C", alpha = 0.8) +
  annotate("text", x = 2.25, y = 2.6, label = "MISTAKE #1", fontface = "bold", size = 4, color = "white") +

  annotate("text", x = 2.25, y = 1.3,
           label = "Treating COMMON cause\nas if it were SPECIAL\n\nResult: Tampering\nIncreased variation!",
           size = 3, color = "white", lineheight = 0.9) +
  # Mistake 2
  annotate("rect", xmin = 5.5, xmax = 10, ymin = 0, ymax = 3, fill = "#F39C12", alpha = 0.8) +
  annotate("text", x = 7.75, y = 2.6, label = "MISTAKE #2", fontface = "bold", size = 4, color = "white") +

  annotate("text", x = 7.75, y = 1.3,
           label = "Treating SPECIAL cause\nas if it were COMMON\n\nResult: Missing signals\nDefects produced!",
           size = 3, color = "white", lineheight = 0.9) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Two Mistakes That Waste Resources and Reduce Quality",
       subtitle = "Control charts help us avoid both mistakes") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10))
```

<details>
<summary>The Funnel Experiment: Why Tampering Makes Things Worse</summary>

**Deming's Funnel Experiment** demonstrates why adjusting a stable process increases variation:

**Setup:** Drop a ball through a funnel onto a target. The ball lands near (but not exactly on) the target due to common cause variation.

**Rule 1 (Correct):** Leave the funnel alone. Variation remains constant.

**Rule 2 (Tampering):** After each drop, move the funnel to compensate for the last error.
- Result: Variation DOUBLES!

**Rule 3 (More Tampering):** Move funnel to compensate relative to the target.
- Result: Variation increases without bound!

**Lesson:** Adjusting a stable process based on individual deviations (common cause) actually makes the process worse. Only adjust when special causes are identified.

**Real-World Example:** An operator notices a part is 0.02mm below target and adjusts the machine. The next part is 0.03mm above target (the adjustment plus normal variation). They adjust again... and the process oscillates with increasing variation.

</details>

### When is a Process "In Control"?

A process is **in statistical control** when:

1. Only common cause variation is present
2. All points fall within control limits
3. No non-random patterns exist
4. The process is stable and predictable

```{r in-control-definition, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="In-Control vs. Out-of-Control Process", fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
set.seed(456)
in_control <- data.frame(
  x = 1:25,
  y = rnorm(25, 50, 2),
  status = "In Control"
)

out_control <- data.frame(
  x = 1:25,
  y = c(rnorm(15, 50, 2), rnorm(10, 54, 2)),
  status = "Out of Control"
)

combined <- rbind(in_control, out_control)

ggplot(combined, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "#3498DB") +

  scale_color_manual(values = c("FALSE" = "#3498DB", "TRUE" = "#E74C3C"), guide = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~status) +
  labs(title = "Recognizing In-Control vs. Out-of-Control Conditions",
       x = "Sample Number", y = "Measured Value") +

    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 11)
  )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Control Charts: The Foundation of SPC

### What is a Control Chart?

A **control chart** is a graph that shows process data over time with statistically determined control limits. It provides a visual method for distinguishing between common and special cause variation.

```{r control-chart-anatomy, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Anatomy of a Control Chart", fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
set.seed(789)
data <- data.frame(

```{r chart-components, echo=FALSE}
components <- tibble(
  `Component` = c("**Center Line (CL)**", "**Upper Control Limit (UCL)**",
                  "**Lower Control Limit (LCL)**", "**Data Points**", "**Zones A, B, C**"),
  `Description` = c("The process average; target for the process",
                    "Upper boundary of expected variation (+3σ)",
                    "Lower boundary of expected variation (-3σ)",

)

components %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Control Chart Components") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#3498DB", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "14em")
```

### Why ±3 Sigma?

Control limits are set at **±3 standard deviations** from the center line. This is not arbitrary:

- For a normal distribution, 99.73% of data falls within ±3σ
- Only 0.27% (about 3 in 1000) will fall outside by chance
- This balances the risk of both mistakes (false alarms vs. missed signals)

```{r normal-distribution, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Normal Distribution and Control Limits", fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
x <- seq(-4, 4, 0.01)
y <- dnorm(x)

df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2, color = "#2C3E50") +
  geom_area(data = subset(df, x >= -3 & x <= 3), fill = "#3498DB", alpha = 0.5) +

```

<details>
<summary>Question: Variable vs. Attribute Data - What's the Difference?</summary>

**Variable Data (Measured):**
- Can take any value within a range
- Measured on a continuous scale
- Examples: length, weight, temperature, voltage, pressure
- More information per measurement
- Smaller sample sizes needed

**Attribute Data (Counted):**
- Discrete categories (good/bad, pass/fail)
- Counted, not measured
- Examples: number of defects, number of rejects, yes/no
- Less information per observation
- Larger sample sizes needed

**When to Use Each:**
- Use variable data when you CAN measure (more powerful)
- Use attribute data when you can only classify or count
- Sometimes you convert variable to attribute (e.g., pass/fail based on tolerance)

## Variable Control Charts

### X-bar and R Chart

The **X-bar and R chart** is the most common control chart for variable data. It tracks both the process average (X-bar) and the process spread (Range).

#### Constructing an X-bar/R Chart

**Step 1:** Collect data in subgroups (typically 4-5 samples)

```{r xbar-r-data, echo=TRUE}
# Example: Measuring shaft diameter (mm)
# 25 subgroups of 5 measurements each

set.seed(100)
n_subgroups <- 25
n_samples <- 5

# Generate data
data <- matrix(rnorm(n_subgroups * n_samples, mean = 25.00, sd = 0.05),
               nrow = n_subgroups, ncol = n_samples)

# Add a special cause (shift) at subgroup 18
data[18, ] <- data[18, ] + 0.12

# Calculate statistics for each subgroup
xbar <- apply(data, 1, mean)
R <- apply(data, 1, function(x) max(x) - min(x))

cat("First 5 subgroups:\n")
print(round(data[1:5, ], 4))
cat("\nX-bar values:", round(xbar[1:5], 4))
cat("\nRange values:", round(R[1:5], 4))
```

**Step 2:** Calculate control limits

```{r xbar-r-limits, echo=TRUE}
# Control chart constants for n=5
A2 <- 0.577
D3 <- 0      # D3 = 0 for n < 7
D4 <- 2.114

# Calculate grand mean and average range
X_double_bar <- mean(xbar)
R_bar <- mean(R)

cat("Grand Mean (X-double-bar):", round(X_double_bar, 4), "mm\n")
cat("Average Range (R-bar):", round(R_bar, 4), "mm\n\n")

# X-bar chart limits
UCL_xbar <- X_double_bar + A2 * R_bar
LCL_xbar <- X_double_bar - A2 * R_bar

cat("X-bar Chart:\n")
cat("  UCL =", round(UCL_xbar, 4), "mm\n")
cat("  CL  =", round(X_double_bar, 4), "mm\n")
cat("  LCL =", round(LCL_xbar, 4), "mm\n\n")

# R chart limits
UCL_R <- D4 * R_bar
LCL_R <- D3 * R_bar

cat("R Chart:\n")
cat("  UCL =", round(UCL_R, 4), "mm\n")
cat("  CL  =", round(R_bar, 4), "mm\n")
cat("  LCL =", round(LCL_R, 4), "mm\n")
```

**Step 3:** Plot the charts

```{r xbar-r-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="X-bar and R Control Charts", fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
# Create data frame for plotting
plot_data <- data.frame(
  subgroup = 1:n_subgroups,
  xbar = xbar,
  R = R
)

# X-bar chart
p1 <- ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = subgroup, y = xbar)) +
  geom_line(color = "#3498DB") +
  geom_point(aes(color = xbar > UCL_xbar | xbar < LCL_xbar), size = 3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = X_double_bar, color = "#27AE60", size = 1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(UCL_xbar, LCL_xbar), color = "#E74C3C", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("FALSE" = "#3498DB", "TRUE" = "#E74C3C"), guide = "none") +
  annotate("text", x = 26, y = UCL_xbar, label = paste("UCL =", round(UCL_xbar, 3)), hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", x = 26, y = X_double_bar, label = paste("CL =", round(X_double_bar, 3)), hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", x = 26, y = LCL_xbar, label = paste("LCL =", round(LCL_xbar, 3)), hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "X-bar Chart (Process Average)", x = "", y = "X-bar (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")) +
  xlim(0, 29)

# R chart
p2 <- ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = subgroup, y = R)) +
  geom_line(color = "#F39C12") +
  geom_point(aes(color = R > UCL_R | R < LCL_R), size = 3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = R_bar, color = "#27AE60", size = 1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(UCL_R, LCL_R), color = "#E74C3C", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("FALSE" = "#F39C12", "TRUE" = "#E74C3C"), guide = "none") +
  annotate("text", x = 26, y = UCL_R, label = paste("UCL =", round(UCL_R, 3)), hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", x = 26, y = R_bar, label = paste("CL =", round(R_bar, 3)), hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", x = 26, y = LCL_R, label = "LCL = 0", hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "R Chart (Process Spread)", x = "Subgroup Number", y = "Range (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")) +
  xlim(0, 29)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 1)
```

**Interpretation:** Subgroup 18 shows a point above the UCL on the X-bar chart, indicating a special cause. Investigation reveals the cause and corrective action is taken.

### Control Chart Constants

```{r constants-table, echo=FALSE}
constants <- tibble(
  `n` = 2:10,
  `A2` = c(1.880, 1.023, 0.729, 0.577, 0.483, 0.419, 0.373, 0.337, 0.308),

  `D4` = c(3.267, 2.574, 2.282, 2.114, 2.004, 1.924, 1.864, 1.816, 1.777),
  `d2` = c(1.128, 1.693, 2.059, 2.326, 2.534, 2.704, 2.847, 2.970, 3.078)
)

constants %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Control Chart Constants for X-bar/R Charts") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
                full_width = FALSE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#3498DB", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(4, background = "#D5F5E3")  # Highlight n=5 row
```

### Individual and Moving Range (I-MR) Chart

When sample size is **n = 1** (one measurement per time period), use the **I-MR chart**.

```{r imr-example, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Individual and Moving Range Chart", fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
set.seed(200)
n_points <- 30

# Generate individual measurements
individuals <- c(rnorm(20, mean = 100, sd = 3),
                 rnorm(10, mean = 103, sd = 3))  # Shift at point 21

# Calculate moving range
MR <- c(NA, abs(diff(individuals)))

# Calculate limits
X_bar <- mean(individuals[1:20])  # Use only stable period
MR_bar <- mean(MR[2:20], na.rm = TRUE)

UCL_I <- X_bar + 2.66 * MR_bar
LCL_I <- X_bar - 2.66 * MR_bar
UCL_MR <- 3.267 * MR_bar

# Create data frame
imr_data <- data.frame(
  obs = 1:n_points,
  individual = individuals,
  MR = MR
)

# I Chart
p1 <- ggplot(imr_data, aes(x = obs, y = individual)) +
  geom_line(color = "#3498DB") +

  labs(title = "Individual (I) Chart", x = "", y = "Individual Value") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

# MR Chart
p2 <- ggplot(imr_data[-1, ], aes(x = obs, y = MR)) +
  geom_line(color = "#F39C12") +
  geom_point(aes(color = MR > UCL_MR), size = 3) +

## Attribute Control Charts

### p Chart (Proportion Defective)

The **p chart** tracks the proportion of defective units when sample sizes may vary.

```{r p-chart-example, echo=TRUE}

# Add a special cause on day 15
defectives[15] <- rbinom(1, sample_sizes[15], prob = 0.12)

# Calculate proportion
p <- defectives / sample_sizes

# Calculate p-bar (weighted average)
p_bar <- sum(defectives) / sum(sample_sizes)

## Interpreting Control Charts

### Out-of-Control Signals (Western Electric Rules)

A point doesn't have to be outside the control limits to indicate a problem. The **Western Electric Rules** identify non-random patterns:

<summary>Interactive Exercise: Identify the Out-of-Control Condition</summary>

**Look at this sequence of points (standardized values):**

0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 0.9, 1.4, 1.6, 1.3, 1.8, -0.2, 0.3

**Questions:**

1. Are any points beyond ±3σ?
2. Is there a Rule 4 violation (8 consecutive on one side)?
3. What pattern do you see?

**Answers:**

1. No — all points are within ±3σ
2. **YES** — Points 1-8 are all positive (above center line)
3. This is a **Rule 4 violation**: 8 consecutive points above the center line indicates a likely process shift upward

**Action:** Investigate what changed — new material lot? Different operator? Equipment adjustment?

<summary>Question: When to use Cp/Cpk vs. Pp/Ppk?</summary>

**Cp/Cpk (Process Capability):**
- Uses within-subgroup variation (σ estimated from R-bar/d2)
- Represents the POTENTIAL capability if process is in control
- Use for ongoing process monitoring
- Requires process to be in statistical control

**Pp/Ppk (Process Performance):**
- Uses overall standard deviation (s) of all data
- Represents ACTUAL performance including all variation
- Use for initial capability studies or when process stability is unknown
- Includes both common and special cause variation

**Rule of Thumb:**
- If Pp ≈ Cp and Ppk ≈ Cpk → Process is stable
- If Pp < Cp or Ppk < Cpk → Process has special cause variation (not in control)

## Review Questions

### Conceptual Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: What is the difference between common cause and special cause variation?</summary>

**Common Cause Variation:**
- Inherent to the process
- Always present
- Random and predictable
- Many small factors
- System-level improvement required
- Examples: machine vibration, material variation, ambient temperature

**Special Cause Variation:**
- External to normal process
- Intermittent or new
- Non-random patterns
- Specific assignable cause
- Local action to eliminate
- Examples: tool breakage, new operator, bad material lot

**Key Point:** Only act on special causes. Attempting to adjust for common cause variation (tampering) makes the process worse.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Why are control limits set at ±3 sigma rather than ±2 sigma?</summary>

**At ±3σ:**
- 99.73% of data falls within limits (when in control)
- Only 0.27% false alarm rate (about 3 per 1000 points)
- Good balance between detecting real problems and avoiding false alarms

**If we used ±2σ:**
- 95.45% of data within limits
- 4.55% false alarm rate (about 45 per 1000 points!)
- Too many false alarms → operators ignore the chart

**If we used ±4σ:**
- 99.99% within limits
- Almost no false alarms
- But we'd miss real problems (low sensitivity)

**The ±3σ choice balances:**
- Risk of false alarm (treating common cause as special)
- Risk of missed signal (treating special cause as common)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: When would you use an I-MR chart instead of an X-bar/R chart?</summary>

**Use I-MR Chart When:**

1. **Sample size is n = 1** — only one measurement per time period
2. **Destructive testing** — can't afford multiple samples
3. **Expensive measurement** — time or cost prohibitive
4. **Continuous process** — each reading is independent (batch process)
5. **Long intervals** — measurements far apart in time
6. **Homogeneous batches** — within-batch variation is negligible

**Examples:**
- Daily chemical batch analysis
- Weekly calibration check
- Each lot incoming inspection (one sample per lot)
- Continuous process temperature readings

**Caution:** I-MR charts are less sensitive than X-bar charts because averaging in subgroups reduces noise.

</details>

### Calculation Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 4: Calculate control limits for an X-bar/R chart given the following data.</summary>

**Given:**
- 20 subgroups of n = 4 measurements
- Grand mean (X-double-bar) = 50.25
- Average range (R-bar) = 2.40
- Constants for n = 4: A2 = 0.729, D3 = 0, D4 = 2.282

**Calculate UCL and LCL for both charts.**

**Solution:**

**X-bar Chart:**
```
UCL = X-double-bar + A2 × R-bar
UCL = 50.25 + 0.729 × 2.40 = 50.25 + 1.75 = 52.00

LCL = X-double-bar - A2 × R-bar
LCL = 50.25 - 0.729 × 2.40 = 50.25 - 1.75 = 48.50

CL = 50.25
```

**R Chart:**
```
UCL = D4 × R-bar = 2.282 × 2.40 = 5.48

LCL = D3 × R-bar = 0 × 2.40 = 0

CL = 2.40
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: Calculate Cp and Cpk for a process with the following data.</summary>

**Given:**
- Specification: 100 ± 5 (USL = 105, LSL = 95)
- Process mean = 102
- Process standard deviation (σ) = 1.5

**Solution:**

**Cp (Potential Capability):**
```
Cp = (USL - LSL) / (6σ)
Cp = (105 - 95) / (6 × 1.5)
Cp = 10 / 9 = 1.11
```

**Cpk (Actual Capability):**
```
Cpu = (USL - X-bar) / (3σ) = (105 - 102) / (3 × 1.5) = 3 / 4.5 = 0.67
Cpl = (X-bar - LSL) / (3σ) = (102 - 95) / (3 × 1.5) = 7 / 4.5 = 1.56

Cpk = min(Cpu, Cpl) = min(0.67, 1.56) = 0.67
```

**Interpretation:**
- Cp = 1.11 suggests process spread could fit within specs IF centered
- Cpk = 0.67 shows process is NOT capable because it's shifted toward USL
- Action: Center the process closer to 100 (target)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 6: A p chart has p-bar = 0.04 and sample size n = 200. Calculate control limits.</summary>

**Solution:**

**Center Line:**
```
CL = p-bar = 0.04 (4% defective)
```

**Upper Control Limit:**
```
UCL = p-bar + 3 × √(p-bar × (1 - p-bar) / n)
UCL = 0.04 + 3 × √(0.04 × 0.96 / 200)
UCL = 0.04 + 3 × √(0.000192)
UCL = 0.04 + 3 × 0.01386
UCL = 0.04 + 0.0416 = 0.0816 (8.16%)
```

**Lower Control Limit:**
```
LCL = p-bar - 3 × √(p-bar × (1 - p-bar) / n)
LCL = 0.04 - 0.0416 = -0.0016

Since LCL cannot be negative: LCL = 0
```

**Final Limits:**
- UCL = 8.16%
- CL = 4.00%
- LCL = 0%

</details>

### Application Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 7: You observe 8 consecutive points above the center line but all within control limits. What does this indicate?</summary>

**This is a Rule 4 violation (Western Electric Rules).**

**What it indicates:**
- The process mean has shifted upward
- This is a SPECIAL CAUSE signal
- Even though no points are beyond limits, the pattern is not random

**Probability analysis:**
- Probability of a point above CL (random) = 0.5
- Probability of 8 consecutive above CL = 0.5^8 = 0.0039 (0.39%)
- This is very unlikely by chance alone

**Action required:**
1. Stop and mark the chart
2. Investigate what changed around the time of the first high point
3. Check: new material lot? Tool change? Operator change? Temperature?
4. Correct the cause
5. Monitor to verify process returns to normal

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 8: A process has Cp = 2.0 but Cpk = 1.0. What does this tell you?</summary>

**Analysis:**

**Cp = 2.0 means:**
- Process spread (6σ) is half the specification width
- The process COULD produce no defects if centered
- Potential capability is excellent

**Cpk = 1.0 means:**
- Process is off-center
- Actual capability is only marginal
- Some defects are being produced

**The difference (Cp - Cpk = 1.0) indicates:**
- The process mean is shifted 3σ from the target
- One side has much less margin than the other

**Visual:**
```
LSL        Target        USL
|           |           |
      [====PROCESS====]
      ↑ shifted to one side
```

**Action:**
- Center the process on target
- After centering, Cpk should approach Cp (both ≈ 2.0)
- This is an adjustment action, not a variation reduction

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 9: Why should you always analyze the R chart before the X-bar chart?</summary>

**The R chart should be analyzed first because:**

1. **Control limits depend on variation:**
   - X-bar limits are calculated using R-bar
   - If R is out of control, X-bar limits are unreliable

2. **R chart is more sensitive to variation changes:**
   - Tool wear shows on R chart before X-bar
   - Inconsistent setup appears as increased R

3. **Process must be stable in variation first:**
   - A process can't be "in control" if variation is changing
   - Stable variation is a prerequisite for evaluating the mean

4. **Different actions for each:**
   - R chart problem → variation issue (consistency)
   - X-bar problem → centering issue (average)

**Rule:** If R chart is out of control, fix that FIRST before interpreting the X-bar chart.

## Introduction to TPM

### What is Total Productive Maintenance?

**Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)** is a holistic approach to equipment maintenance that strives to achieve perfect production with no breakdowns, no defects, and no accidents. It involves everyone in the organization, from operators to top management.

<summary>Question: Why involve operators in maintenance?</summary>

**Operators are the first line of defense because:**

1. **They know the equipment:** Operators work with machines every day and notice subtle changes
2. **Early detection:** Small problems are detected before becoming major failures
3. **Ownership mindset:** People take better care of things they "own"
4. **Reduced response time:** Operators can address minor issues immediately
5. **Freed maintenance resources:** Technicians can focus on complex tasks

**Example:** An operator notices a slight vibration change in a motor. Under traditional maintenance, they might ignore it. Under TPM, they report it, potentially preventing a $50,000 breakdown.

> "No one knows a machine better than the person who operates it every day."

## The Eight Pillars of TPM

TPM is built on **eight pillars**, each addressing a specific aspect of equipment management and organizational culture.

## Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

### What is OEE?

**Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** is the primary metric of TPM. It measures how effectively equipment is being used by combining three factors: Availability, Performance, and Quality.

<summary>Interactive Exercise: Calculate OEE</summary>

**Given the following shift data, calculate OEE:**

- Shift length: 480 minutes
- Planned breaks: 40 minutes
- Equipment breakdown: 30 minutes
- Setup/changeover: 20 minutes
- Ideal cycle time: 1 minute/part
- Total parts produced: 350
- Rejected parts: 14

**Work through the calculation:**

**Solution:**

```
Planned Production Time = 480 - 40 = 440 minutes
Run Time = 440 - 30 - 20 = 390 minutes

Availability = 390 / 440 = 88.6%

Theoretical Output = 390 / 1 = 390 parts
Performance = 350 / 390 = 89.7%

Quality = (350 - 14) / 350 = 336 / 350 = 96.0%

OEE = 88.6% × 89.7% × 96.0% = 76.3%
```

**Interpretation:** This is "Good" performance, above the typical range. The biggest opportunity is in Performance (speed losses).

<details>
<summary>Question: Why is predictive maintenance better than preventive maintenance?</summary>

**Preventive Maintenance (Time-Based):**
- Replaces parts at fixed intervals regardless of condition
- May replace parts still in good condition (waste)
- May miss failures that occur before scheduled replacement
- Based on average life, not individual component condition

**Predictive Maintenance (Condition-Based):**
- Monitors actual equipment condition
- Replaces parts when condition indicates need
- Maximizes component life
- Provides warning time to plan repairs

**Example:**
- Preventive: Replace bearing every 6 months (may last 9 months or fail at 4 months)
- Predictive: Monitor vibration; replace when trending indicates 2-3 weeks to failure
- Result: Optimal component life, planned downtime, no unexpected failures

**Cost Comparison:**
- Reactive repair: $10,000 (including secondary damage, lost production)
- Preventive replacement: $3,000 (may waste $1,000 in parts life)
- Predictive replacement: $2,500 (optimal timing, minimal waste)

## Review Questions

### Conceptual Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 1: What does "Total" mean in Total Productive Maintenance?</summary>

**"Total" has three dimensions:**

1. **Total participation:** Everyone participates, from operators to top management
2. **Total equipment effectiveness:** Aim for maximum OEE (zero losses)
3. **Total system:** Covers the entire equipment lifecycle, from design to disposal

**Key insight:** TPM is not just a maintenance program — it's a company-wide philosophy where everyone takes responsibility for equipment care.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Why is OEE calculated as a product rather than a sum?</summary>

**OEE uses multiplication because losses are sequential and compound:**

1. **Availability** determines how much time is available
2. **Performance** determines how much of that time is productive
3. **Quality** determines how much of that production is good

**Example:**
- If each factor is 90%: OEE = 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 72.9% (not 270% or 90%)
- This reflects reality: you can only achieve quality on parts that were produced (performance) during time the machine ran (availability)

**Why this matters:**
- Small improvements in all three factors compound
- 5% improvement in each: 0.85 × 0.85 × 0.85 = 61% → 0.90 × 0.90 × 0.90 = 73%
- Focus on the weakest factor first for biggest impact

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: What is the difference between autonomous maintenance and planned maintenance?</summary>

| Aspect | Autonomous Maintenance | Planned Maintenance |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Who** | Operators | Maintenance technicians |
| **What** | Basic care (clean, inspect, lubricate) | Complex repairs, overhauls |
| **When** | Daily, during operation | Scheduled intervals |
| **Skills** | Basic equipment knowledge | Technical expertise |
| **Goal** | Prevent deterioration | Restore/improve equipment |

**They complement each other:**
- AM catches problems early (first line of defense)
- PM provides specialized skills when needed
- Together they achieve zero breakdowns

</details>

### Calculation Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 4: Calculate OEE given the following data.</summary>

**Given:**
- Shift length: 480 minutes
- Breaks: 30 minutes
- Changeover: 45 minutes
- Breakdown: 20 minutes
- Ideal cycle time: 30 seconds (0.5 min)
- Total parts produced: 580
- Rejected parts: 23

**Solution:**

```
Planned Production Time = 480 - 30 = 450 minutes
Run Time = 450 - 45 - 20 = 385 minutes

Availability = 385 / 450 = 85.6%

Theoretical Output = 385 / 0.5 = 770 parts
Performance = 580 / 770 = 75.3%

Quality = (580 - 23) / 580 = 557 / 580 = 96.0%

OEE = 85.6% × 75.3% × 96.0% = 61.9%
```

**Analysis:** Performance is the biggest opportunity for improvement (75.3% vs. targets of 95%). Investigate minor stops and speed losses.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: A machine has OEE of 65% with Availability 90%, Performance 80%, Quality 90%. Which factor should be prioritized?</summary>

**Analysis:**

Current state:
- Availability: 90% (Gap to world class: 5%)
- Performance: 80% (Gap to world class: 15%)
- Quality: 90% (Gap to world class: 9%)

**Performance should be prioritized because:**

1. **Biggest gap:** 15 percentage points below world class (95%)
2. **Biggest OEE impact:** Improving performance 10% → OEE = 90% × 90% × 90% = 72.9%
3. **Often overlooked:** Speed losses and minor stops are frequently accepted as normal

**Investigation areas for performance:**
- Minor stops (jams, blockages, sensor trips)
- Reduced speed operation
- Idling and waiting
- Operator pace

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 6: If current OEE is 60% and target is 85%, what improvement is needed in each component assuming equal improvement?</summary>

**Solution:**

Current: 60% = A × P × Q

If we improve each equally, we need:
- Target: 85% = A' × P' × Q'
- If A' = P' = Q' = x, then x³ = 0.85
- x = ∛0.85 = 0.947 = 94.7%

**Each component needs to reach approximately 95%**

**Check:** 0.947 × 0.947 × 0.947 = 0.849 ≈ 85%

**If current factors are A=80%, P=85%, Q=88%:**
- Availability needs: +15 points (80% → 95%)
- Performance needs: +10 points (85% → 95%)
- Quality needs: +7 points (88% → 95%)

**Prioritize by gap size:** Availability first, then Performance, then Quality.

</details>

### Application Questions

<details>
<summary>Question 7: An operator notices a small oil leak on a machine. Under traditional maintenance vs. TPM, what happens?</summary>

**Traditional Maintenance Approach:**
1. Operator continues running machine
2. May or may not report to maintenance
3. If reported, added to backlog
4. Maintenance addresses when convenient (days/weeks)
5. Leak worsens, potential bearing damage
6. Eventually leads to breakdown

**TPM Approach:**
1. Operator notices during routine inspection
2. Tags the abnormality immediately
3. Determines if operator can fix (blue tag) or needs maintenance (red tag)
4. If simple: operator tightens fitting or adds sealant
5. If complex: maintenance prioritizes based on severity
6. Root cause investigated to prevent recurrence
7. Finding shared in team meeting

**Key Differences:**
- **Ownership:** Operator takes responsibility vs. "not my job"
- **Speed:** Immediate action vs. delayed response
- **Prevention:** Fixed before failure vs. reactive repair
- **Cost:** $10 seal vs. $5,000 bearing replacement + downtime

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 8: List five items an operator should check during daily autonomous maintenance.</summary>

**Five Essential Daily AM Checks:**

1. **Cleanliness:** Remove chips, debris, dust; clean safety windows and sensors
   - *Why:* Contamination causes wear, sensor malfunctions, quality issues

2. **Lubrication:** Check oil levels, grease points, coolant level
   - *Why:* Inadequate lubrication causes friction, heat, accelerated wear

3. **Fasteners:** Check for loose bolts, guards, covers
   - *Why:* Loose fasteners cause vibration, safety hazards, misalignment

4. **Leaks:** Look for oil, coolant, air, hydraulic leaks
   - *Why:* Leaks indicate seal failure, waste resources, create hazards

5. **Abnormal sounds/vibration:** Listen and feel during startup
   - *Why:* Changes indicate developing problems (bearings, alignment)

**Bonus items:**
- Safety guards in place
- Emergency stops functional
- Pressure/temperature gauges in normal range
- No unusual smells (burning, chemical)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 9: Explain how SMED relates to OEE improvement.</summary>

**SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Die) directly improves Availability:**

**Loss #2: Setup and Adjustment** is an availability loss captured in OEE.

**How SMED helps:**

1. **Reduces changeover time:**
   - Before SMED: 45-minute changeover
   - After SMED: 10-minute changeover
   - Gain: 35 minutes per changeover

2. **Impact on OEE:**
   - If 2 changeovers per shift: 70 minutes saved
   - On 450-minute shift: Availability improves 15%+

3. **Secondary benefits:**
   - More changeovers become practical
   - Smaller batch sizes possible
   - Flexibility increased
   - Less WIP inventory

**SMED Process:**
1. Separate internal (machine stopped) from external (while running) setup
2. Convert internal to external where possible
3. Streamline remaining internal operations
4. Practice and standardize

**Example:** Die change on press
- External: Stage next die, prepare tools, preheat
- Internal: Remove old die, install new die, adjust
- Target: All possible work done while machine runs

## Introduction to Troubleshooting

**Troubleshooting** is the systematic process of identifying, diagnosing, and resolving problems in equipment, processes, or systems. For electromechanical technicians, effective troubleshooting is perhaps the most valuable skill you can develop.

### The Cost of Downtime

Equipment failures and process problems have significant financial impacts:

```{r downtime-costs, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
industry_data <- data.frame(
  Industry = c("Automotive", "Food Processing", "Aerospace/Defense",
               "Pharmaceutical", "Oil & Gas"),
  Cost_Per_Hour = c(22000, 15000, 35000, 25000, 50000),
  Avg_Downtime_Hours = c(4, 6, 8, 5, 12)
)

industry_data$Total_Cost <- industry_data$Cost_Per_Hour * industry_data$Avg_Downtime_Hours

ggplot(industry_data, aes(x = reorder(Industry, Cost_Per_Hour), y = Cost_Per_Hour)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue", width = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0("$", format(Cost_Per_Hour, big.mark = ","))),
            hjust = -0.1, size = 4) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(), limits = c(0, 60000)) +
  labs(title = "Average Cost of Unplanned Downtime by Industry",
       subtitle = "Per hour of production stoppage",
       x = "",
       y = "Cost per Hour (USD)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 11)
  )
```

### Reactive vs. Proactive Problem Solving

```{r reactive-proactive, echo=FALSE}
approach_comparison <- data.frame(
  Aspect = c("Timing", "Focus", "Stress Level", "Cost", "Learning", "Documentation"),
  Reactive = c("After failure occurs", "Quick fix to restore operation",
               "High - production pressure", "High - emergency repairs",
               "Limited - rush to fix", "Often skipped"),
  Proactive = c("Before or early in failure", "Root cause elimination",
                "Lower - planned approach", "Lower - scheduled work",
                "High - thorough analysis", "Systematic and complete")
)

kable(approach_comparison, col.names = c("Aspect", "Reactive Approach", "Proactive Approach"),
      caption = "Comparison of Problem-Solving Approaches") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "15%") %>%
  column_spec(2, background = "#ffcccc", width = "42%") %>%
  column_spec(3, background = "#ccffcc", width = "43%")
```

<details><summary>**Think About It**: Why do organizations often default to reactive troubleshooting?</summary>

Common reasons include:
- **Time pressure**: Production demands make it tempting to apply quick fixes
- **Lack of training**: Technicians may not know RCA methodologies
- **Reward systems**: Organizations may reward "firefighters" who quickly restore production
- **Missing data**: Without good records, patterns are hard to identify
- **Culture**: "We've always done it this way" mentality

The irony is that reactive troubleshooting actually costs more time in the long run due to recurring problems.
</details>

## Systematic Troubleshooting Methodology

Effective troubleshooting follows a structured approach rather than random trial-and-error.

### The DMAIC Troubleshooting Framework

```{r troubleshooting-flow, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
# Create troubleshooting process flow
steps <- data.frame(
  step = 1:6,
  name = c("DEFINE", "MEASURE", "ANALYZE", "IMPLEMENT", "CONTROL", "DOCUMENT"),
  description = c(
    "Clearly state the problem",
    "Gather data and observations",
    "Identify root cause",
    "Apply corrective action",
    "Verify solution works",
    "Record findings"
  ),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
  y = rep(1, 6)
)

ggplot(steps, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x, xend = x + 0.8, y = y, yend = y),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")),
               color = "gray50", size = 1.5,
               data = steps[1:5,]) +
  geom_point(size = 25, color = c("#e74c3c", "#3498db", "#2ecc71",
                                   "#f39c12", "#9b59b6", "#1abc9c")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = step), color = "white", size = 8, fontface = "bold") +
  geom_text(aes(label = name, y = y + 0.25), size = 4, fontface = "bold") +
  geom_text(aes(label = description, y = y - 0.25), size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 6.8)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 1.5)) +
  labs(title = "Systematic Troubleshooting Process") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
```

### Step 1: Define the Problem

A well-defined problem is half-solved. Use the **5W2H** method:

```{r 5w2h-table, echo=FALSE}
w2h <- data.frame(
  Question = c("WHAT", "WHERE", "WHEN", "WHO", "WHY", "HOW", "HOW MUCH"),
  Description = c(
    "What is the problem? What is happening vs. what should happen?",
    "Where does the problem occur? Location, machine, station?",
    "When did it start? When does it occur? Continuous or intermittent?",
    "Who discovered it? Who is affected? Who was operating?",
    "Why is this a problem? What is the impact?",
    "How was the problem detected? How is it manifesting?",
    "How often? How many units affected? What is the magnitude?"
  ),
  Example = c(
    "Motor overheating on conveyor line 3",
    "Discharge end of conveyor, motor housing",
    "Started Monday, occurs after 2 hours of operation",
    "Operator noticed, maintenance called, affects packaging dept",
    "Risk of motor failure, line stoppage, safety hazard",
    "Detected by high-temp alarm at 85°C",
    "Occurs every day, 100% of shifts, 15°C above normal"
  )
)

kable(w2h, col.names = c("Question", "What to Ask", "Example Response"),
      caption = "5W2H Problem Definition Framework") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2c3e50", width = "12%") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "40%") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "48%", background = "#f8f9fa")
```

### Problem Statement Template

> **Good Problem Statement Format:**
> "[WHAT] is occurring at [WHERE] since [WHEN], affecting [WHO/WHAT], with a magnitude of [HOW MUCH]."

**Example:**
> "Motor overheating (85°C vs. normal 70°C) is occurring at Conveyor Line 3 discharge motor since Monday morning, affecting packaging department production, with the condition occurring every shift after approximately 2 hours of operation."

<details><summary>**Practice**: Write a problem statement for this scenario</summary>

**Scenario:** An injection molding machine is producing parts with short shots (incomplete fill). The problem was noticed by the quality inspector during the night shift. About 15% of parts are affected. The issue seems worse when running the larger 500g parts compared to the smaller 200g parts.

**Sample Problem Statement:**
"Short shots (incomplete cavity fill) are occurring on Injection Molding Machine #4 since night shift on Tuesday, affecting 15% of parts produced, with the defect rate increasing significantly when running 500g parts compared to 200g parts."
</details>

### Step 2: Gather Data and Observations

Before making any changes, collect information systematically:

```{r data-gathering, echo=FALSE}
data_sources <- data.frame(
  Source = c("Visual Inspection", "Operator Interview", "Machine Parameters",
             "Historical Records", "Product/Output", "Environmental"),
  What_to_Check = c(
    "Physical condition, wear, contamination, alignment, damage",
    "What changed? When did it start? Any unusual events?",
    "Temperatures, pressures, speeds, currents, positions",
    "Maintenance logs, previous repairs, similar issues",
    "Defect patterns, measurements, reject rates",
    "Temperature, humidity, vibration, power quality"
  ),
  Tools = c(
    "Flashlight, mirror, magnifier, camera",
    "Open-ended questions, active listening",
    "HMI screens, gauges, multimeter, thermal camera",
    "CMMS, logbooks, work orders",
    "Calipers, gauges, CMM, visual inspection",
    "Thermometer, hygrometer, vibration analyzer"
  )
)

kable(data_sources, col.names = c("Data Source", "What to Check", "Tools/Methods"),
      caption = "Systematic Data Gathering Checklist") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "18%")
```

### The "Change Analysis" Approach

Many problems are caused by changes. Ask:

- What changed recently?
- New materials, suppliers, or batches?
- New operators or different shifts?
- Maintenance performed?
- Environmental changes (weather, season)?
- Software updates or parameter changes?
- New products or recipes running?

```{r change-timeline, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=5}
# Create a change timeline visualization
timeline_data <- data.frame(
  event = c("New lubricant\nsupplier", "Operator\ntraining", "PM\ncompleted",
            "Software\nupdate", "Problem\nstarted", "New shift\nschedule"),
  date = as.Date(c("2024-01-15", "2024-01-22", "2024-02-01",
                   "2024-02-05", "2024-02-07", "2024-02-10")),
  y = c(1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1),
  type = c("Change", "Change", "Change", "Change", "Problem", "Change")
)

ggplot(timeline_data, aes(x = date, y = 0)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "gray50", size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = date, yend = y), color = "gray70") +
  geom_point(aes(y = y, color = type), size = 8) +
  geom_text(aes(y = y, label = event), vjust = ifelse(timeline_data$y > 0, -1, 2),
            size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = format(date, "%b %d")), vjust = 2, size = 2.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Change" = "steelblue", "Problem" = "red")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-2, 2)) +
  labs(title = "Change Timeline Analysis",
       subtitle = "Map changes against problem occurrence to identify correlations",
       x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14)
  )
```

## Understanding Root Cause vs. Symptoms

A critical concept in troubleshooting is distinguishing between different levels of causation.

### The Causation Hierarchy

```{r causation-levels, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
# Create causation hierarchy pyramid
levels <- data.frame(
  level = c("Symptom", "Immediate Cause", "Contributing Cause", "Root Cause"),
  y = c(4, 3, 2, 1),
  width = c(3, 4, 5, 6),
  description = c(
    "Observable effect of the problem",
    "Direct cause of the symptom",
    "Factors that enabled the cause",
    "Fundamental reason - fix this to prevent recurrence"
  ),
  example = c(
    "Motor is overheating",
    "Bearing is worn",
    "Lubrication was inadequate",
    "No PM schedule for bearing lubrication"
  ),
  color = c("#e74c3c", "#f39c12", "#3498db", "#27ae60")
)

ggplot(levels, aes(x = 0, y = y)) +
  geom_tile(aes(width = width, height = 0.8, fill = color), color = "white", size = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = level), fontface = "bold", size = 5, color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = description, y = y - 0.25), size = 3, color = "white") +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 4, label = "Example: Motor is overheating",
           hjust = 0, size = 3.5, fontface = "italic") +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 3, label = "Example: Bearing is worn",
           hjust = 0, size = 3.5, fontface = "italic") +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 2, label = "Example: Lubrication inadequate",
           hjust = 0, size = 3.5, fontface = "italic") +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 1, label = "Example: No PM schedule exists",
           hjust = 0, size = 3.5, fontface = "italic") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 7)) +
  labs(title = "Causation Hierarchy",
       subtitle = "Dig deeper to find the root cause - don't stop at symptoms") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Why Finding Root Cause Matters

```{r fix-comparison, echo=FALSE}
fix_levels <- data.frame(
  Level = c("Symptom", "Immediate Cause", "Root Cause"),
  Fix = c("Add cooling fan to motor", "Replace worn bearing",
          "Implement PM schedule with lubrication tasks"),
  Result = c("Motor runs cooler temporarily", "Motor works for a while",
             "Problem eliminated permanently"),
  Recurrence = c("Problem returns in days", "Problem returns in months",
                 "Problem does not recur"),
  Cost_Short = c("$50", "$200", "$500"),
  Cost_Long = c("$5000+ (repeated failures)", "$2400 (annual replacements)",
                "$500 (one-time implementation)")
)

kable(fix_levels, col.names = c("Fix Level", "Action Taken", "Immediate Result",
                                 "Recurrence", "Short-term Cost", "Long-term Cost"),
      caption = "Comparison of Fixes at Different Causation Levels") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%

  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "12%")
```

## The 5 Whys Technique

The **5 Whys** is a simple but powerful technique developed by Sakichi Toyoda and used within Toyota's manufacturing methods.

### How It Works

1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why?" to identify the cause
3. Ask "Why?" again about that cause
4. Continue asking "Why?" until you reach the root cause
5. Typically requires 5 iterations (sometimes more, sometimes less)

### 5 Whys Example: Production Line Stoppage

```{r five-whys-visual, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=8}
whys <- data.frame(
  level = 1:6,
  question = c("Problem:", "Why #1:", "Why #2:", "Why #3:", "Why #4:", "Why #5:"),
  answer = c(
    "Production line stopped",
    "The robot arm stopped moving",
    "The servo motor overloaded and faulted",
    "The gearbox was binding due to wear",
    "The gearbox lubrication had degraded",
    "The lubrication was never changed\n(No PM schedule existed)"
  ),
  y = 6:1
)

ggplot(whys, aes(x = 1, y = y)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = level), width = 5, height = 0.8, color = "white", size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(x = -0.8, label = question), hjust = 1, fontface = "bold", size = 4) +
  geom_text(aes(label = answer), hjust = 0.5, size = 3.5,
            color = ifelse(whys$level == 6, "white", "black")) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.5, xend = 0.5, y = y - 0.4, yend = y - 0.6),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")),
               data = whys[1:5,], color = "gray40") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#3498db", high = "#c0392b", guide = "none") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-2.5, 3.5)) +
  labs(title = "5 Whys Analysis: Production Line Stoppage",
       subtitle = "Each 'Why?' digs deeper toward the root cause") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 11))
```

### 5 Whys Template

```{r five-whys-template, echo=FALSE}
template <- data.frame(
  Step = c("Problem Statement", "Why #1", "Why #2", "Why #3", "Why #4", "Why #5", "Root Cause"),
  Description = c(
    "Clear, specific description of what happened",
    "First-level cause (usually technical/physical)",
    "Why did that first cause occur?",
    "Why did the second cause occur?",
    "Why did the third cause occur?",
    "Why did the fourth cause occur?",
    "The fundamental cause that, if fixed, prevents recurrence"
  ),
  Type = c("Symptom", "Physical", "Physical/Human", "Human/Process",
           "Process/System", "System/Culture", "Root")
)

kable(template, col.names = c("Step", "Description", "Typical Cause Type"),
      caption = "5 Whys Analysis Template") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "18%") %>%
  row_spec(7, background = "#d4edda", bold = TRUE)
```

### Multiple Branches in 5 Whys

Sometimes a problem has multiple causes. When you encounter this, branch your analysis:

```{r branching-whys, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=7}
# Create branching 5 whys diagram
nodes <- data.frame(
  id = 1:9,
  label = c(
    "Defective welds\non assembly",
    "Insufficient\nheat input",
    "Wrong wire\nfeed speed",
    "Operator set\nincorrect parameter",
    "No parameter\nsheet at station",
    "Contaminated\nbase metal",
    "Parts not\ncleaned properly",
    "Cleaning step\nskipped",
    "Rush order\npressure"
  ),
  x = c(0, -2, -3, -3, -3, 2, 2, 2, 2),
  y = c(5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1),
  branch = c("Main", "A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "B")
)

edges <- data.frame(
  from_x = c(0, -2, -3, -3, 0, 2, 2, 2),
  from_y = c(5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, 2),
  to_x = c(-2, -3, -3, -3, 2, 2, 2, 2),
  to_y = c(4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1)
)

ggplot() +
  geom_segment(data = edges, aes(x = from_x, y = from_y, xend = to_x, yend = to_y),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")), color = "gray50") +
  geom_label(data = nodes, aes(x = x, y = y, label = label, fill = branch),
             size = 3, label.padding = unit(0.3, "lines")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Main" = "#e74c3c", "A" = "#3498db", "B" = "#27ae60"),
                    guide = "none") +
  annotate("text", x = -3, y = 0.3, label = "Root Cause A:\nMissing parameter documentation",
           fontface = "bold", size = 3.5, color = "#3498db") +
  annotate("text", x = 2, y = 0.3, label = "Root Cause B:\nSchedule pressure affecting quality",
           fontface = "bold", size = 3.5, color = "#27ae60") +
  labs(title = "Branching 5 Whys Analysis",
       subtitle = "When multiple causes exist, analyze each branch separately") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

<details><summary>**Practice Exercise**: Perform a 5 Whys Analysis</summary>

**Scenario:** A CNC machine produced 50 parts that were all 0.5mm undersize on a critical diameter.

Try to complete the 5 Whys analysis before looking at the sample answer below.

---

**Sample Analysis:**

1. **Problem:** CNC produced 50 undersize parts
2. **Why #1:** The tool offset was set incorrectly
3. **Why #2:** The operator entered the wrong offset value
4. **Why #3:** The operator misread the setup sheet
5. **Why #4:** The setup sheet had poor formatting and small print
6. **Why #5:** No standard format exists for setup documentation

**Root Cause:** Lack of standardized, clear setup documentation

**Corrective Actions:**
- Create standardized setup sheet template with large, clear fonts
- Add visual verification step (photo of correct setup)
- Implement first-piece inspection requirement before production run

## Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram

The **Ishikawa diagram**, also called a **fishbone diagram** or **cause-and-effect diagram**, was developed by Kaoru Ishikawa in the 1960s. It provides a structured way to brainstorm and categorize potential causes.

### The 6M Categories

Manufacturing problems are typically organized using the **6M** categories:

```{r 6m-categories, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=7}
categories <- data.frame(
  category = c("Man\n(People)", "Machine\n(Equipment)", "Material",

  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
  examples = c(
    "Training, skill,\nfatigue, attention",
    "Wear, calibration,\nmaintenance, age",
    "Quality, variation,\nsupplier, contamination",
    "Procedures, sequence,\nparameters, SOP",
    "Accuracy, precision,\ncalibration, method",
    "Temperature, humidity,\nvibration, cleanliness"
  )
)

ggplot(categories, aes(x = x, y = 1)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = category), width = 0.9, height = 1.5, color = "white", size = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = category), y = 1.3, fontface = "bold", size = 4, color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = examples), y = 0.7, size = 2.8, color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#e74c3c", "#3498db", "#27ae60",

## Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)

**Fault Tree Analysis** is a top-down, deductive analysis method that uses Boolean logic to analyze undesired events. Originally developed for the aerospace industry, FTA is particularly useful for complex systems with multiple potential failure paths.

### FTA Symbols

```{r fta-symbols, echo=FALSE}
symbols <- data.frame(
  Symbol = c("Rectangle", "Circle", "Diamond", "House", "AND Gate", "OR Gate"),
  Name = c("Intermediate Event", "Basic Event", "Undeveloped Event",
           "Normal Event", "AND Gate", "OR Gate"),
  Meaning = c(
    "A fault event that results from combination of other events",
    "A basic failure that cannot be broken down further",
    "Event not analyzed further (outside scope or insufficient data)",
    "An event expected to occur during normal operation",
    "Output occurs only if ALL inputs occur",
    "Output occurs if ANY input occurs"
  ),
  Example = c(
    "Pump fails to deliver flow",
    "Motor winding burnout",
    "Power grid failure",
    "Normal wear over time",
    "Both sensor AND controller fail",
    "Either fuse blows OR breaker trips"
  )
)

kable(symbols, caption = "Fault Tree Analysis Symbols") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%

### Calculating Probability with FTA

FTA allows quantitative risk analysis by calculating the probability of the top event:

**OR Gate:** P(output) = 1 - [(1 - P~A~) × (1 - P~B~) × ...]
*Simplified:* P(output) ≈ P~A~ + P~B~ (when probabilities are small)

**AND Gate:** P(output) = P~A~ × P~B~ × ...

```{r fta-calculation, echo=TRUE}
# Example: Calculate top event probability
# Basic event probabilities (annual failure rates)
P_breaker_trip <- 0.02
P_motor_fail <- 0.01
P_impeller_worn <- 0.03
P_impeller_break <- 0.005
P_shaft_seize <- 0.008
P_tank_empty <- 0.05
P_valve_closed <- 0.01
P_line_blocked <- 0.02

# Impeller failure (OR gate)
P_impeller_fail <- 1 - (1 - P_impeller_worn) * (1 - P_impeller_break)
cat("P(Impeller failure):", round(P_impeller_fail, 4), "\n")

# Mechanical failure (OR gate)
P_mechanical <- 1 - (1 - P_motor_fail) * (1 - P_impeller_fail) * (1 - P_shaft_seize)
cat("P(Mechanical failure):", round(P_mechanical, 4), "\n")

# No fluid available (OR gate)
P_no_fluid <- 1 - (1 - P_tank_empty) * (1 - P_valve_closed) * (1 - P_line_blocked)
cat("P(No fluid available):", round(P_no_fluid, 4), "\n")

# Top event: Pump fails (OR gate)
P_top <- 1 - (1 - P_breaker_trip) * (1 - P_mechanical) * (1 - P_no_fluid)
cat("P(Pump fails to deliver flow):", round(P_top, 4), "\n")
cat("This represents a", round(P_top * 100, 1), "% annual probability of failure")
```

## Pareto Analysis

**Pareto Analysis** is based on the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule): roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. This helps prioritize problem-solving efforts.

### Creating a Pareto Chart

```{r pareto-example, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=7}
# Defect data for a manufacturing line
defects <- data.frame(
  Defect_Type = c("Surface Scratch", "Dimensional Error", "Burrs",
                  "Missing Feature", "Wrong Material", "Contamination",
                  "Color Mismatch", "Packaging Damage"),
  Count = c(145, 98, 67, 34, 28, 21, 15, 12)
)

# Sort by count
defects <- defects[order(-defects$Count),]
defects$Defect_Type <- factor(defects$Defect_Type, levels = defects$Defect_Type)

# Calculate cumulative percentage
defects$Cumulative <- cumsum(defects$Count)
defects$Cum_Percent <- defects$Cumulative / sum(defects$Count) * 100

ggplot(defects, aes(x = Defect_Type)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Count), stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue", width = 0.7) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Cum_Percent * max(Count) / 100, group = 1),
            color = "#e74c3c", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Cum_Percent * max(Count) / 100),
             color = "#e74c3c", size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(y = Count, label = Count), vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5) +
  geom_text(aes(y = Cum_Percent * max(Count) / 100,
                label = paste0(round(Cum_Percent, 0), "%")),
            vjust = -1, hjust = -0.2, size = 3, color = "#e74c3c") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 80 * max(defects$Count) / 100,
             linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
  annotate("text", x = 7.5, y = 80 * max(defects$Count) / 100 + 5,
           label = "80% line", size = 3.5, color = "gray40") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Defect Count",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~. * 100 / max(defects$Count), name = "Cumulative %")
  ) +
  labs(title = "Pareto Chart: Manufacturing Defects by Type",
       subtitle = "Focus on Surface Scratch and Dimensional Error to address 58% of all defects",
       x = "Defect Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
    axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "#e74c3c")
  )
```

### Interpreting Pareto Analysis

```{r pareto-interpretation, echo=TRUE}
# Pareto analysis interpretation
defects <- data.frame(
  Defect = c("Surface Scratch", "Dimensional Error", "Burrs",
             "Missing Feature", "Wrong Material", "Contamination",
             "Color Mismatch", "Packaging Damage"),
  Count = c(145, 98, 67, 34, 28, 21, 15, 12)
)

defects <- defects[order(-defects$Count),]
defects$Cumulative_Pct <- cumsum(defects$Count) / sum(defects$Count) * 100

# Identify the "vital few" (those that contribute to 80%)
vital_few <- defects[defects$Cumulative_Pct <= 80 |
                      c(TRUE, defects$Cumulative_Pct[-nrow(defects)] < 80),]

cat("Total defects:", sum(defects$Count), "\n")
cat("\nVital Few (contributing to ~80% of defects):\n")
print(vital_few[, c("Defect", "Count", "Cumulative_Pct")])
cat("\nFocusing on these", nrow(vital_few), "defect types addresses",
    round(max(vital_few$Cumulative_Pct), 1), "% of all defects")
```

### Stratified Pareto Analysis

Sometimes you need to break down categories further:

```{r stratified-pareto, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# Stratified analysis of "Surface Scratch" defect
scratch_causes <- data.frame(
  Cause = c("Handling damage", "Fixture marks", "Chip scratches",
            "Conveyor marks", "Tool marks", "Unknown"),
  Count = c(52, 38, 28, 15, 8, 4)
)

scratch_causes <- scratch_causes[order(-scratch_causes$Count),]
scratch_causes$Cause <- factor(scratch_causes$Cause, levels = scratch_causes$Cause)
scratch_causes$Cumulative <- cumsum(scratch_causes$Count)
scratch_causes$Cum_Pct <- scratch_causes$Cumulative / sum(scratch_causes$Count) * 100

ggplot(scratch_causes, aes(x = Cause)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Count), stat = "identity", fill = "#27ae60", width = 0.7) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Cum_Pct * max(Count) / 100, group = 1),
            color = "#e74c3c", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Cum_Pct * max(Count) / 100),
             color = "#e74c3c", size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(y = Count, label = Count), vjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 80 * max(scratch_causes$Count) / 100,
             linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Count",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~. * 100 / max(scratch_causes$Count), name = "Cumulative %")
  ) +
  labs(title = "Stratified Pareto: Causes of Surface Scratch Defects",
       subtitle = "Drilling down into the #1 defect type",
       x = "Scratch Cause") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14)
  )
```

## Is/Is Not Analysis

**Is/Is Not Analysis** is a structured comparison technique that helps narrow down the scope and identify distinguishing factors of a problem.

### Is/Is Not Matrix

```{r is-isnot-example, echo=FALSE}
is_isnot <- data.frame(
  Dimension = c("WHAT", "WHAT", "WHERE", "WHERE", "WHEN", "WHEN", "EXTENT", "EXTENT"),
  Question = c(
    "What object has the problem?",
    "What is the defect/symptom?",
    "Where is the problem observed?",
    "Where on the object is the defect?",
    "When was it first observed?",
    "When in the process/cycle?",
    "How many units affected?",
    "Is it trending up/down/stable?"
  ),
  IS = c(
    "Motor on Line 3",
    "Overheating (85°C)",
    "Packaging area, Station 4",
    "Motor housing, bearing end",
    "Monday morning shift",
    "After 2 hours of operation",
    "100% - every shift",
    "Stable - same every day"
  ),
  IS_NOT = c(
    "Motors on Lines 1, 2, 4",
    "Noise, vibration, or failure",
    "Any other station",
    "Drive end, junction box",
    "Before weekend (Friday OK)",
    "Cold start or end of shift",
    "Intermittent",
    "Getting worse over time"
  ),
  Distinction = c(
    "Line 3 motor is older, different model",
    "Thermal issue, not mechanical yet",
    "Station 4 has higher load demand",
    "Bearing end runs hotter normally",
    "Something changed over weekend",
    "Heat buildup issue",
    "Consistent problem",
    "Stable - not progressive failure"
  )
)

kable(is_isnot, col.names = c("Dimension", "Question", "IS", "IS NOT", "What's Different?"),
      caption = "Is/Is Not Analysis: Motor Overheating Problem") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "8%") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "20%") %>%
  column_spec(3, background = "#d4edda", width = "22%") %>%
  column_spec(4, background = "#f8d7da", width = "22%") %>%
  column_spec(5, background = "#fff3cd", width = "28%")
```

### Key Insights from Is/Is Not Analysis

From the example above, we can identify:

1. **Line 3 specific** - Not a general problem across all lines
2. **Thermal, not mechanical** - Overheating but no noise/vibration yet
3. **After warm-up** - Heat accumulation issue
4. **Started after weekend** - Something changed

**Investigation focus:** What changed over the weekend? Check maintenance logs, any work done on Line 3, any environmental changes.

## Case Study: Automotive Welding Defects

Let's work through a comprehensive troubleshooting case using multiple RCA tools.

### The Problem

A Tier-1 automotive supplier is experiencing weld porosity defects on a critical structural component. Customer complaints have increased, and the plant has received a quality alert.

### Initial Problem Definition (5W2H)

```{r case-5w2h, echo=FALSE}
case_problem <- data.frame(
  Question = c("WHAT", "WHERE", "WHEN", "WHO", "WHY", "HOW", "HOW MUCH"),
  Answer = c(
    "Porosity (gas pockets) in MIG welds on crossmember subassembly",
    "Robot welding Cell 4, occurring at weld joint W-23 (corner weld)",
    "Started approximately 2 weeks ago, occurs on all shifts",
    "Detected by customer during their incoming inspection",
    "Customer rejecting parts; risk of production line stop",
    "Visible voids on X-ray inspection; some visible to naked eye",
    "Estimated 8% of parts affected (up from baseline of 0.5%)"
  )
)

kable(case_problem, col.names = c("Question", "Details"),
      caption = "Case Study Problem Definition") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%

```

### Fishbone Diagram Findings

After brainstorming with the cross-functional team:

```{r case-fishbone-findings, echo=FALSE}
fishbone_findings <- data.frame(

## Documentation and Knowledge Management

Proper documentation ensures learnings are captured and problems don't recur.

### Key Documentation Elements

```{r documentation-checklist, echo=FALSE}
doc_elements <- data.frame(
  Element = c("Problem Description", "Timeline", "Data Collected",

kable(doc_elements, caption = "RCA Documentation Checklist") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "18%")
```

### Creating a Troubleshooting Knowledge Base

Build organizational memory by:

1. **Standardized templates** - Use consistent formats for all RCA documents
2. **Searchable database** - Store in CMMS, SharePoint, or dedicated quality system
3. **Categories and tags** - Equipment type, failure mode, root cause category
4. **Cross-references** - Link related issues and solutions
5. **Regular reviews** - Periodic analysis of trends and patterns

## Summary

Effective troubleshooting and root cause analysis require:

1. **Systematic approach** - Don't guess; follow a structured methodology
2. **Clear problem definition** - Use 5W2H to clearly define what you're solving
3. **Data-driven analysis** - Collect facts before jumping to conclusions
4. **Root cause focus** - Don't stop at symptoms; dig to fundamental causes
5. **Multiple tools** - Use 5 Whys, Fishbone, FTA, Pareto as appropriate
6. **Effective corrective actions** - Aim for elimination, not just mitigation
7. **Verification** - Confirm your fix actually works with data
8. **Documentation** - Capture learnings to prevent recurrence

Remember: The goal isn't just to fix today's problem - it's to prevent tomorrow's.

## Review Questions

<details><summary>**Question 1**: What is the difference between a symptom, immediate cause, and root cause? Provide an example of each for a machine that is producing parts with excessive surface roughness.</summary>

**Answer:**

- **Symptom**: The observable effect of the problem
  - *Example: Parts have Ra surface roughness of 3.2 μm when specification is 1.6 μm*

- **Immediate cause**: The direct, technical cause of the symptom
  - *Example: Cutting tool is worn beyond its effective life*

- **Root cause**: The fundamental reason that, if eliminated, prevents recurrence
  - *Example: No tool life monitoring system exists; operators judge tool changes by intuition rather than data*

Fixing the root cause (implementing tool life tracking) prevents the problem from recurring, whereas just replacing the tool (addressing immediate cause) means it will happen again.
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 2**: A food processing plant is experiencing frequent jams on their packaging line. Perform a 5 Whys analysis given the following information: The jam occurs at the carton loading station, started last week, happens 4-5 times per shift, and the maintenance team found the timing of the pusher mechanism is off.</summary>

**Answer:**

1. **Problem**: Carton loading station jams 4-5 times per shift
2. **Why #1**: Cartons are not in position when pusher activates → Timing mismatch
3. **Why #2**: Pusher timing is off by approximately 0.3 seconds
4. **Why #3**: Timing adjustment was changed during last week's maintenance
5. **Why #4**: Technician didn't have correct specification for timing setting
6. **Why #5**: Maintenance procedure doesn't include timing specifications

**Root Cause**: Maintenance procedures lack critical parameter specifications

**Corrective Actions**:
- Update maintenance procedure with correct timing specification (180ms ± 10ms)
- Restore timing to correct setting immediately
- Review other procedures for missing specifications
- Add parameter verification checklist to PM activities
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 3**: Create a fishbone diagram outline (list the potential causes under each 6M category) for the problem "CNC machine producing parts 0.05mm oversize."</summary>

**Answer:**

**MAN (People)**
- Operator entered wrong offset
- Incorrect setup procedure followed
- Inadequate training on new program
- Fatigue/distraction during setup

**MACHINE (Equipment)**
- Spindle thermal growth
- Ballscrew wear/backlash
- Tool holder runout
- Axis positioning error

**MATERIAL**
- Material hardness variation
- Different lot from supplier
- Material springback
- Incorrect material grade

**METHOD (Process)**
- Wrong tool offset entered
- Program error in G-code
- Incorrect cutting parameters
- Missing roughing pass

**MEASUREMENT**
- Gauge out of calibration
- Wrong measurement technique
- Temperature affecting measurement
- Incorrect datum reference

**MOTHER NATURE (Environment)**
- Shop temperature variation
- Coolant temperature change
- Vibration from nearby equipment
- Humidity affecting gauges
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 4**: Given the following defect data from a sheet metal stamping operation, create a Pareto analysis and identify the vital few defects to focus on.</summary>

| Defect Type | Count |
|------------|-------|
| Scratches | 89 |
| Burrs | 156 |
| Wrinkles | 45 |
| Splits/Cracks | 28 |
| Dimensional | 112 |
| Surface Dents | 67 |
| Missing Features | 18 |

**Answer:**

```{r pareto-practice, echo=TRUE}
# Create and analyze the data
defects <- data.frame(
  Type = c("Burrs", "Dimensional", "Scratches", "Surface Dents",
           "Wrinkles", "Splits/Cracks", "Missing Features"),
  Count = c(156, 112, 89, 67, 45, 28, 18)
)

# Sort by count descending
defects <- defects[order(-defects$Count),]

# Calculate percentages
defects$Percent <- defects$Count / sum(defects$Count) * 100
defects$Cumulative <- cumsum(defects$Percent)

# Display results
print(defects)

# Identify vital few
vital_few <- defects$Type[defects$Cumulative <= 80 |
                           c(TRUE, defects$Cumulative[-nrow(defects)] < 80)]
cat("\nVital Few (contributing to ~80%):", paste(vital_few, collapse = ", "))
```

The **vital few** are Burrs, Dimensional errors, and Scratches - addressing these three defect types would address approximately 69% of all defects. Adding Surface Dents would bring the total to 82%.
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 5**: What are the key differences between verification and validation in the context of corrective actions?</summary>

**Answer:**

| Aspect | Verification | Validation |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Question asked | Did we implement the action correctly? | Did the action solve the problem? |
| Focus | Process compliance | Results/outcomes |
| Timing | During/immediately after implementation | Ongoing monitoring after implementation |
| Methods | Audits, checklists, inspections | Data analysis, trend charts, SPC |
| Example | Confirm new sensor was installed per specification | Measure defect rate over 30 days to confirm reduction |

**Verification** confirms the action was done right.
**Validation** confirms we did the right action.

Both are required - an action can be implemented perfectly (verified) but still not solve the problem (not validated).
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 6**: An aerospace manufacturer has a requirement to use the 8D methodology for customer complaints. What happens in D3 (Containment) and why is it critical?</summary>

**Answer:**

**D3 Containment Actions** protect the customer while the root cause investigation continues. Key activities include:

1. **Immediate actions**:
   - Quarantine suspect inventory (tagged, segregated)
   - 100% inspection of suspect lots
   - Increase monitoring at subsequent operations
   - Sort parts at customer location if already shipped

2. **Documentation**:
   - Identify affected lot numbers, date codes, serial numbers
   - Quantify the scope of potential exposure
   - Document all containment actions taken

3. **Communication**:
   - Notify customer of actions being taken
   - Alert downstream operations
   - Inform suppliers if incoming material involved

**Why critical**:
- Prevents additional defective product from reaching the customer
- Limits the scope of the problem (cost, liability)
- Demonstrates responsiveness to customer
- Buys time for proper root cause investigation
- In aerospace, safety-of-flight concerns make containment essential

Without effective containment, the problem continues while you investigate, increasing customer impact and costs exponentially.
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 7**: Why might a team's 5 Whys analysis stop too early? What are signs that you haven't reached the true root cause?</summary>

**Answer:**

**Reasons teams stop too early**:
1. **Blame arrives** - Analysis ends at "operator error" without asking why the error occurred
2. **Comfort zone** - Team stops when they reach a cause they can easily fix
3. **Time pressure** - Rush to implement a fix, skipping deeper analysis
4. **Technical limit** - Team lacks expertise to go deeper into certain areas
5. **Defensiveness** - Reaching causes that implicate management or systems creates resistance

**Signs you haven't reached root cause**:
1. **Recurrence** - If the fix is "more training" or "be more careful," problem will return
2. **Human-based answer** - Root causes should typically be systems/processes, not individuals
3. **No prevention mechanism** - If fixing this cause doesn't prevent future occurrences, keep asking why
4. **Can still ask "why?"** - If there's a logical next level to investigate
5. **Administrative fix only** - If the solution is just a procedure or checklist with no engineering controls

**Example of stopping too early**:
- Stopping at: "Operator set wrong parameter"
- Should continue: Why? → No parameter sheet at workstation → Why? → No standard work documentation exists → Root cause: Missing standardized work process

The true root cause typically relates to systems, processes, or management decisions rather than individual actions.
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 8**: Describe how you would use Pareto analysis in a stratified manner to drill down into a quality problem.</summary>

**Answer:**

**Stratified Pareto Analysis** involves creating multiple levels of Pareto charts, progressively drilling down into the vital few categories.

**Example: High scrap rate at a machining shop**

**Level 1: Scrap by defect type**
1. Create Pareto of all defect types
2. Result: "Dimensional errors" is 45% of all scrap - investigate this first

**Level 2: Dimensional errors by machine**
1. Create Pareto of dimensional errors broken down by machine
2. Result: Machine #4 accounts for 60% of dimensional errors

**Level 3: Machine #4 dimensional errors by feature**
1. Create Pareto of which dimensions are failing on Machine #4
2. Result: Bore diameter is 70% of Machine #4 dimensional issues

**Level 4: Bore diameter issues by shift/operator**
1. Create Pareto by shift
2. Result: Evenly distributed - not operator-dependent (machine issue confirmed)

**Final Analysis**: Investigate boring operation on Machine #4 specifically - likely tool wear, spindle issue, or program error.

The stratified approach efficiently narrows focus from "we have a scrap problem" to "boring operation on Machine #4 has a systematic error."
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 9**: A defense contractor needs to analyze a safety-critical failure. Why might Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) be preferred over simpler methods like 5 Whys?</summary>

**Answer:**

**FTA advantages for safety-critical analysis**:

1. **Handles complexity**:
   - Safety-critical systems often have multiple redundancies and complex failure paths
   - FTA can model combinations of events that must occur together (AND gates) or alternatively (OR gates)
   - 5 Whys follows single linear path; FTA captures parallel paths

2. **Quantitative capability**:
   - FTA allows probability calculations for top event
   - Can identify minimum cut sets (smallest combinations that cause failure)
   - Supports reliability and safety integrity level (SIL) calculations
   - Defense/aerospace require quantitative risk assessment

3. **Documentation requirements**:
   - Regulatory bodies (FAA, DoD) often require FTA for critical systems
   - Provides auditable, traceable analysis
   - Standard symbols and methodology

4. **Identifies hidden failures**:
   - Can reveal single points of failure
   - Shows where redundancy is (or isn't) effective
   - Identifies common cause failures that defeat redundancy

5. **Design improvement**:
   - Visual representation helps identify where to add safeguards
   - Sensitivity analysis shows which basic events most affect risk
   - Supports design reviews and safety cases

**Example**: A missile guidance system failure
- 5 Whys might identify one cause path
- FTA would show all possible failure paths, calculate overall failure probability, and identify that two specific sensor failures AND a software error all occurring together could cause the top event, even though each alone is unlikely.

## Introduction to Measurement Systems Analysis

**Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)** is the science of evaluating the quality of measurement processes. Before we can trust our data for process control, quality decisions, or capability studies, we must first verify that our measurement system is capable of providing reliable results.

### Why MSA Matters

> "You can't improve what you can't measure - but you also can't improve what you measure incorrectly."

Consider this scenario:

```{r msa-importance, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
set.seed(42)
# Simulate the same part measured with good vs. poor measurement systems
true_value <- 25.00
n_measurements <- 50

# Good measurement system
good_system <- rnorm(n_measurements, mean = true_value, sd = 0.02)

# Poor measurement system
poor_system <- rnorm(n_measurements, mean = true_value + 0.05, sd = 0.15)

measurement_data <- data.frame(
  Measurement = c(good_system, poor_system),
  System = rep(c("Good Measurement System\n(Low variation, no bias)",
                  "Poor Measurement System\n(High variation, biased)"), each = n_measurements)
)

ggplot(measurement_data, aes(x = Measurement, fill = System)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = true_value, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 25.00 - 0.10, linetype = "solid", color = "darkred", size = 0.8) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 25.00 + 0.10, linetype = "solid", color = "darkred", size = 0.8) +
  annotate("text", x = true_value, y = 12, label = "True Value",
           color = "red", fontface = "bold", hjust = -0.1) +
  annotate("text", x = 24.90, y = 12, label = "LSL", color = "darkred", hjust = 1.1) +
  annotate("text", x = 25.10, y = 12, label = "USL", color = "darkred", hjust = -0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~System, ncol = 1) +
  labs(title = "The Same Parts Measured by Two Different Systems",
       subtitle = "Poor measurement systems lead to incorrect accept/reject decisions",
       x = "Measured Value (mm)", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
        strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 11))
```

### MSA in Industry Standards

MSA is required by multiple quality standards:

- **IATF 16949** (Automotive): Requires MSA for all measurement systems referenced in control plans
- **AS9100** (Aerospace): Requires demonstrated measurement capability
- **ISO 9001**: Requires monitoring and measurement resources to be suitable
- **FDA 21 CFR Part 820** (Medical Devices): Requires validated measurement equipment

## Components of Measurement Variation

Total measurement variation comes from multiple sources. Understanding these components is essential for improvement.

### The Measurement System Model

## Accuracy Studies

Accuracy studies evaluate how well the measurement system indicates the true value.

### Bias

**Bias** is the systematic error - the difference between the average of measurements and the true (reference) value.

$$\text{Bias} = \bar{x}_{observed} - x_{reference}$$

```{r bias-example, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
set.seed(456)
reference <- 50.00
measurements <- rnorm(25, mean = 50.08, sd = 0.03)

bias_data <- data.frame(
  measurement = 1:25,
  value = measurements
)

ggplot(bias_data, aes(x = measurement, y = value)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = reference, color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(measurements), color = "blue", size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = 26, y = reference, label = "Reference = 50.00",
           hjust = 0, color = "red", fontface = "bold") +
  annotate("text", x = 26, y = mean(measurements),
           label = paste0("Average = ", round(mean(measurements), 3)),
           hjust = 0, color = "blue", fontface = "bold") +
  annotate("segment", x = 24, xend = 24, y = reference, yend = mean(measurements),
           arrow = arrow(ends = "both", length = unit(0.1, "inches")), color = "purple") +
  annotate("text", x = 23.5, y = (reference + mean(measurements))/2,
           label = paste0("Bias = ", round(mean(measurements) - reference, 3)),
           hjust = 1, color = "purple", fontface = "bold") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +
  labs(title = "Bias Study: Measuring a Reference Standard",
       subtitle = "25 repeated measurements of a certified reference block",
       x = "Measurement Number", y = "Measured Value (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14))
```

```{r bias-calculation, echo=TRUE}
# Bias study calculation
reference_value <- 50.000  # Certified reference standard
measurements <- c(50.08, 50.07, 50.09, 50.08, 50.06, 50.10, 50.07, 50.08,
                  50.09, 50.08, 50.07, 50.11, 50.08, 50.09, 50.07)

# Calculate bias
average_measured <- mean(measurements)
bias <- average_measured - reference_value

cat("Reference Value:", reference_value, "mm\n")
cat("Average Measured:", round(average_measured, 4), "mm\n")
cat("Bias:", round(bias, 4), "mm\n")
cat("Bias as % of Tolerance (±0.10):", round(abs(bias) / 0.10 * 100, 1), "%\n")

# Statistical test for significance
t_test <- t.test(measurements, mu = reference_value)
cat("\nt-test p-value:", round(t_test$p.value, 4))
if(t_test$p.value < 0.05) {
  cat(" - Bias is statistically significant\n")
} else {
  cat(" - Bias is not statistically significant\n")
}
```

### Linearity

**Linearity** measures whether bias changes across the measurement range. A gauge might be accurate at one end of its range but biased at the other.

```{r linearity-study, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
# Simulate linearity study data
set.seed(789)
reference_points <- c(10, 25, 40, 55, 70)
n_per_point <- 12

linearity_data <- data.frame(
  Reference = rep(reference_points, each = n_per_point),
  Bias = c(
    rnorm(n_per_point, 0.02, 0.01),   # Small positive bias at low end
    rnorm(n_per_point, 0.01, 0.01),   # Slight positive bias
    rnorm(n_per_point, 0.00, 0.01),   # No bias at midpoint
    rnorm(n_per_point, -0.02, 0.01),  # Slight negative bias
    rnorm(n_per_point, -0.05, 0.01)   # Larger negative bias at high end
  )
)

# Fit regression
linearity_model <- lm(Bias ~ Reference, data = linearity_data)

ggplot(linearity_data, aes(x = Reference, y = Bias)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = TRUE, alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
  annotate("text", x = 60, y = 0.04,
           label = paste0("Slope = ", round(coef(linearity_model)[2], 5),
                         "\nLinearity = ", round(abs(coef(linearity_model)[2]) *
                                                   diff(range(reference_points)), 4), " mm"),
           hjust = 0, size = 4, fontface = "bold") +
  labs(title = "Linearity Study Results",
       subtitle = "Bias plotted against reference value across operating range",
       x = "Reference Value (mm)", y = "Bias (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14))
```

```{r linearity-calc, echo=TRUE}
# Linearity calculation
reference <- c(10, 25, 40, 55, 70)
avg_bias <- c(0.020, 0.008, -0.002, -0.018, -0.048)

# Fit linear regression
model <- lm(avg_bias ~ reference)

# Calculate linearity
slope <- coef(model)[2]
range_used <- max(reference) - min(reference)
linearity <- abs(slope) * range_used

cat("Regression equation: Bias =", round(coef(model)[1], 4), "+",
    round(slope, 5), "× Reference\n")
cat("Linearity (slope × range):", round(linearity, 4), "mm\n")
cat("As % of tolerance (±0.10):", round(linearity / 0.10 * 100, 1), "%\n")

# R-squared
cat("R² =", round(summary(model)$r.squared, 3),
    "- indicates", ifelse(summary(model)$r.squared > 0.7, "significant", "minor"),
    "linearity issue\n")
```

### Stability

**Stability** (also called drift) measures whether the measurement system's accuracy changes over time.

```{r stability-study, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
set.seed(321)
# Simulate stability study over 30 days
days <- 1:30
reference <- 25.00

# Measurements showing some drift
measurements <- 25.00 + 0.001 * days + rnorm(30, 0, 0.015)

stability_data <- data.frame(
  Day = days,
  Measurement = measurements,
  Bias = measurements - reference
)

ggplot(stability_data, aes(x = Day, y = Bias)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 3) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", linetype = "dashed", se = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(-0.05, 0.05), linetype = "dotted", color = "orange") +
  annotate("text", x = 30, y = 0.05, label = "±5% tolerance",
           hjust = 1, vjust = -0.5, color = "orange") +
  labs(title = "Stability Study: Daily Measurements of Reference Standard",
       subtitle = "Tracking bias over 30 days to detect drift",
       x = "Day", y = "Bias from Reference (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14))
```

### Stability Control Chart

For ongoing stability monitoring, use a control chart:

```{r stability-control-chart, echo=TRUE}
# Stability monitoring with control chart
reference <- 25.000
measurements <- c(25.012, 25.008, 25.015, 25.018, 25.022, 25.019, 25.025,
                  25.028, 25.031, 25.026, 25.033, 25.038, 25.035, 25.041, 25.039)
days <- 1:15

# Calculate control limits (based on historical sigma)
historical_sigma <- 0.010
x_bar <- mean(measurements[1:5])  # Baseline from first 5 days
UCL <- x_bar + 3 * historical_sigma
LCL <- x_bar - 3 * historical_sigma

cat("Baseline Average:", round(x_bar, 4), "\n")
cat("UCL:", round(UCL, 4), "\n")
cat("LCL:", round(LCL, 4), "\n")

# Check for out-of-control
out_of_control <- which(measurements > UCL | measurements < LCL)
if(length(out_of_control) > 0) {
  cat("\nOut-of-control points on days:", out_of_control, "\n")
  cat("Drift detected - recalibration recommended\n")
} else {
  cat("\nNo out-of-control points - measurement system stable\n")
}
```

## Precision Studies: Gauge R&R

**Gauge R&R** (Repeatability and Reproducibility) is the most common MSA study. It quantifies precision variation.

### Repeatability vs. Reproducibility

```{r rr-visual, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

### Range Method (Short Form)

The Range Method is a quick approximation useful for initial screening.

```{r range-method, echo=TRUE}
# Range Method Gauge R&R Calculation
# Two operators, five parts, two trials each

# Data: Measurements by each operator (2 trials per part)
operator_a <- matrix(c(
  0.85, 0.87,  # Part 1
  0.92, 0.91,  # Part 2
  0.78, 0.80,  # Part 3
  0.95, 0.96,  # Part 4
  0.88, 0.85   # Part 5
), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

operator_b <- matrix(c(
  0.86, 0.88,  # Part 1
  0.93, 0.92,  # Part 2
  0.80, 0.79,  # Part 3
  0.94, 0.97,  # Part 4
  0.87, 0.88   # Part 5
), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# Step 1: Calculate ranges for each part-operator combination
range_a <- apply(operator_a, 1, function(x) max(x) - min(x))
range_b <- apply(operator_b, 1, function(x) max(x) - min(x))

# Step 2: Average range
R_bar <- mean(c(range_a, range_b))

# Step 3: Calculate Repeatability (EV)
# d2 for 2 trials = 1.128
d2_trials <- 1.128
EV <- R_bar / d2_trials

# Step 4: Calculate part averages by operator
avg_a <- rowMeans(operator_a)
avg_b <- rowMeans(operator_b)

# Step 5: Range of operator averages
X_diff <- abs(mean(avg_a) - mean(avg_b))

# d2 for 2 operators = 1.128
d2_operators <- 1.128
n_parts <- 5
n_trials <- 2

# Step 6: Reproducibility (AV)
AV_squared <- (X_diff / d2_operators)^2 - (EV^2 / (n_parts * n_trials))
AV <- sqrt(max(0, AV_squared))

# Step 7: Gauge R&R
GRR <- sqrt(EV^2 + AV^2)

# Step 8: Express as % of tolerance
tolerance <- 0.30  # Example tolerance of ±0.15 = 0.30 total

cat("=== Range Method Gauge R&R Results ===\n\n")
cat("Average Range (R-bar):", round(R_bar, 4), "\n")
cat("Repeatability (EV):", round(EV, 4), "\n")

cat("%GRR (of tolerance):", round(GRR / tolerance * 100 * 5.15, 1), "%\n")
```

### ANOVA Method (Full Study)

The ANOVA method is more accurate and provides additional information.

```{r anova-method, echo=TRUE}
# Full Gauge R&R using ANOVA method
# 10 parts, 3 operators, 3 trials

set.seed(42)

# Generate realistic GRR data
n_parts <- 10
n_operators <- 3

## Attribute Measurement Systems

For pass/fail or categorical measurements (visual inspection, go/no-go gauges), we use **Attribute MSA** or **Attribute Agreement Analysis**.

### Kappa Statistic

The **Kappa statistic** measures agreement beyond chance:

$$\kappa = \frac{P_o - P_e}{1 - P_e}$$

Where:
- $P_o$ = Observed proportion of agreement
- $P_e$ = Expected proportion of agreement by chance

```{r kappa-interpretation, echo=FALSE}
kappa_table <- data.frame(
  Kappa = c("< 0", "0.00 - 0.20", "0.21 - 0.40", "0.41 - 0.60",
            "0.61 - 0.80", "0.81 - 1.00"),
  Interpretation = c("Less than chance agreement", "Slight agreement",
                     "Fair agreement", "Moderate agreement",
                     "Substantial agreement", "Almost perfect agreement"),
  Action = c("Major issues - do not use", "Major improvement needed",
             "Significant improvement needed", "Some improvement needed",
             "Acceptable for most applications", "Excellent - acceptable")
)

kable(kappa_table, caption = "Kappa Statistic Interpretation Guide") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "18%") %>%
  row_spec(5:6, background = "#d4edda") %>%
  row_spec(3:4, background = "#fff3cd") %>%
  row_spec(1:2, background = "#f8d7da")
```

### Attribute Agreement Study Example

```{r attribute-msa, echo=TRUE}
# Attribute Agreement Analysis
# 3 operators inspect 30 samples, 2 trials each
# Reference standard (known good/bad) available

set.seed(123)
n_samples <- 30
n_operators <- 3
n_trials <- 2

# Reference classification (10 bad, 20 good)
reference <- c(rep("Reject", 10), rep("Accept", 20))

# Simulate operator decisions (some disagreement)
simulate_decision <- function(ref, accuracy) {
  sapply(ref, function(r) {
    if(runif(1) < accuracy) r else ifelse(r == "Accept", "Reject", "Accept")
  })
}

# Operators with different accuracy levels
op1_t1 <- simulate_decision(reference, 0.92)
op1_t2 <- simulate_decision(reference, 0.92)
op2_t1 <- simulate_decision(reference, 0.88)
op2_t2 <- simulate_decision(reference, 0.88)
op3_t1 <- simulate_decision(reference, 0.95)
op3_t2 <- simulate_decision(reference, 0.95)

# Calculate agreement metrics

# 1. Within-operator agreement (repeatability)
within_op1 <- mean(op1_t1 == op1_t2)
within_op2 <- mean(op2_t1 == op2_t2)
within_op3 <- mean(op3_t1 == op3_t2)

# 2. Each operator vs. reference
op1_vs_ref <- mean(op1_t1 == reference & op1_t2 == reference)
op2_vs_ref <- mean(op2_t1 == reference & op2_t2 == reference)
op3_vs_ref <- mean(op3_t1 == reference & op3_t2 == reference)

# 3. All operators agree (both trials)
all_agree_t1 <- mean(op1_t1 == op2_t1 & op2_t1 == op3_t1)
all_agree_both <- mean(op1_t1 == op1_t2 & op1_t1 == op2_t1 & op2_t1 == op2_t2 &
                        op2_t1 == op3_t1 & op3_t1 == op3_t2)

cat("=== Attribute Agreement Analysis ===\n\n")
cat("Within-Operator Agreement (Repeatability):\n")
cat("  Operator 1:", round(within_op1 * 100, 1), "%\n")
cat("  Operator 2:", round(within_op2 * 100, 1), "%\n")
cat("  Operator 3:", round(within_op3 * 100, 1), "%\n\n")

cat("Each Operator vs. Reference (both trials correct):\n")
cat("  Operator 1:", round(op1_vs_ref * 100, 1), "%\n")
cat("  Operator 2:", round(op2_vs_ref * 100, 1), "%\n")
cat("  Operator 3:", round(op3_vs_ref * 100, 1), "%\n\n")

cat("  All agree (both trials):", round(all_agree_both * 100, 1), "%\n")
```

### Calculating Kappa

```{r kappa-calculation, echo=TRUE}
# Calculate Kappa for Operator 1 vs Reference
# Create confusion matrix for trial 1
actual <- factor(reference, levels = c("Accept", "Reject"))
predicted <- factor(op1_t1, levels = c("Accept", "Reject"))

confusion <- table(Predicted = predicted, Actual = actual)
print(confusion)

# Calculate proportions
n <- sum(confusion)
p_o <- sum(diag(confusion)) / n  # Observed agreement

# Expected agreement by chance
p_accept <- sum(confusion[1,]) / n * sum(confusion[,1]) / n
p_reject <- sum(confusion[2,]) / n * sum(confusion[,2]) / n
p_e <- p_accept + p_reject

# Kappa
kappa <- (p_o - p_e) / (1 - p_e)

cat("\nKappa Calculation (Operator 1 vs Reference):\n")
cat("Observed agreement (Po):", round(p_o, 3), "\n")
cat("Expected agreement (Pe):", round(p_e, 3), "\n")
cat("Kappa:", round(kappa, 3), "\n")

# Interpretation
if(kappa >= 0.81) {
  cat("Interpretation: Almost perfect agreement\n")
} else if(kappa >= 0.61) {
  cat("Interpretation: Substantial agreement\n")
} else if(kappa >= 0.41) {
  cat("Interpretation: Moderate agreement\n")
} else {
  cat("Interpretation: Fair or less agreement - needs improvement\n")
}
```

### Attribute MSA Best Practices

    "Must have known correct answers to assess accuracy, not just agreement",
    "Minimum 30-50 samples recommended for statistical validity"
  )
)

## Measurement System Resolution

**Resolution** (also called discrimination) is the smallest increment a measurement system can detect.

### Rule of Ten

The **Rule of Ten** states that measurement resolution should be at least 1/10 of:
- The tolerance, OR
- The process variation (6σ)

Whichever is smaller.

```{r resolution-check, echo=TRUE}
# Resolution adequacy check
tolerance <- 0.100  # mm total tolerance
process_6sigma <- 0.080  # 6 sigma of process
gauge_resolution <- 0.010  # mm (smallest increment)

# Check against tolerance
ratio_tolerance <- tolerance / gauge_resolution
# Check against process
ratio_process <- process_6sigma / gauge_resolution

cat("=== Resolution Adequacy Check ===\n\n")
cat("Tolerance:", tolerance, "mm\n")
cat("Process 6σ:", process_6sigma, "mm\n")
cat("Gauge Resolution:", gauge_resolution, "mm\n\n")

cat("Tolerance / Resolution:", ratio_tolerance, ":1")
if(ratio_tolerance >= 10) cat(" - ADEQUATE\n") else cat(" - INADEQUATE\n")

## Summary

Measurement Systems Analysis ensures that your data can be trusted for process control and decision-making:

1. **Before SPC, do MSA** - Garbage in, garbage out; verify measurement quality first
2. **Accuracy components** - Bias, linearity, and stability affect location (average)
3. **Precision components** - Repeatability (within operator) and reproducibility (between operators)
4. **Key metrics** - %GRR < 30% and ndc ≥ 5 for acceptable systems
5. **Resolution matters** - 10:1 ratio vs. tolerance or process variation
6. **Attribute MSA** - Use Kappa for pass/fail decisions
7. **Continuous improvement** - Regular verification and recertification

> "The measurement system is part of the process. Fix the measurement system before trying to fix the process."

## Review Questions

<details><summary>**Question 1**: A gauge R&R study yields %GRR = 45% and ndc = 2. What does this mean and what should be done?</summary>

**Answer:**

This measurement system is **unacceptable**:

- **%GRR = 45%** exceeds the 30% maximum threshold, meaning 45% of the observed variation is due to the measurement system, not the parts
- **ndc = 2** indicates the gauge can only distinguish between 2 categories of parts, which is insufficient for process control (minimum 5 required)

**Actions required:**
1. Investigate root causes of high variation:
   - Check gauge calibration and condition
   - Evaluate operator technique and training
   - Review measurement procedure for ambiguity
   - Assess fixture and part positioning
   - Check gauge resolution adequacy

2. Prioritize improvement efforts:
   - If repeatability (EV) is high: Focus on gauge condition, fixture, technique consistency
   - If reproducibility (AV) is high: Focus on training, procedure clarity, technique standardization

3. Re-run study after improvements

4. If improvements insufficient, consider upgrading to a higher-capability gauge

5. Until resolved, this gauge should not be used for process control or capability studies
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 2**: What is the difference between repeatability and reproducibility? Give an example of each source of error.</summary>

**Answer:**

**Repeatability (Equipment Variation - EV)**:
- Variation when the **same operator** measures the **same part** multiple times with the **same gauge**
- Also called "within-operator" variation
- Represents the inherent precision of the gauge and measurement technique

*Examples of repeatability errors:*
- Gauge resolution limitations
- Gauge mechanism play/backlash
- Inconsistent part positioning in fixture
- Variations in technique even by same operator
- Environmental micro-changes during measurement

**Reproducibility (Appraiser Variation - AV)**:
- Variation when **different operators** measure the **same parts**
- Also called "between-operator" variation
- Represents differences in how operators apply the measurement method

*Examples of reproducibility errors:*
- Different technique between operators (pressure applied, angle, etc.)
- Different interpretation of measurement procedure
- Different reading of analog scales
- Training differences
- Physical differences (eyesight, hand steadiness)
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 3**: Calculate the bias and determine if it is acceptable. Reference value = 25.000 mm, Tolerance = ±0.050 mm, Measured values: 25.012, 25.015, 25.008, 25.011, 25.014, 25.009, 25.013, 25.010, 25.012, 25.011</summary>

**Answer:**

```{r q3-answer, echo=TRUE}
reference <- 25.000
tolerance_total <- 0.100  # ±0.050 = 0.100 total
measurements <- c(25.012, 25.015, 25.008, 25.011, 25.014,
                  25.009, 25.013, 25.010, 25.012, 25.011)

# Calculate bias
mean_measured <- mean(measurements)
bias <- mean_measured - reference

cat("Reference value:", reference, "mm\n")
cat("Mean measured:", round(mean_measured, 4), "mm\n")
cat("Bias:", round(bias, 4), "mm\n\n")

# Express as % of tolerance
bias_pct <- abs(bias) / tolerance_total * 100
cat("Bias as % of tolerance:", round(bias_pct, 1), "%\n")

# T-test for significance
t_result <- t.test(measurements, mu = reference)
cat("T-test p-value:", round(t_result$p.value, 6), "\n\n")

# Acceptability
cat("Acceptability Assessment:\n")
if(bias_pct < 10) {
  cat("- Bias < 10% of tolerance: ACCEPTABLE\n")
} else if(bias_pct < 25) {
  cat("- Bias 10-25% of tolerance: MARGINAL\n")
} else {
  cat("- Bias > 25% of tolerance: UNACCEPTABLE\n")
}

if(t_result$p.value < 0.05) {
  cat("- Bias is statistically significant (p < 0.05)\n")
  cat("- Consider recalibration or technique adjustment\n")
}
```

The bias of 0.0115 mm (11.5% of tolerance) is **marginally acceptable** and statistically significant. Recalibration should be considered.
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 4**: Why is it important to conduct MSA before capability studies (Cp, Cpk)?</summary>

**Answer:**

MSA must precede capability studies because measurement error directly inflates observed variation:

**Mathematical Relationship:**
$$\sigma^2_{observed} = \sigma^2_{process} + \sigma^2_{measurement}$$

**Impacts on Capability:**

1. **Understated Cp/Cpk**: Observed sigma is always larger than true process sigma, so calculated capability will be lower than actual capability

2. **False Alarms**: A capable process may appear incapable due to measurement noise, leading to unnecessary process adjustments or investment

3. **Missed Issues**: High measurement variation masks actual process variation; you can't see problems through the "fog" of gauge error

4. **Bad Decisions**: Incorrect capability data leads to:
   - Wrong process acceptance decisions
   - Inappropriate control limits
   - Misguided improvement investments
   - Customer quality issues

**Example:**
- True process: Cpk = 1.5 (very capable)
- With 50% GRR: Observed Cpk ≈ 0.9 (appears incapable)
- Result: Unnecessary process "improvement" efforts

**Rule of Thumb**: If %GRR > 30%, any capability study is essentially meaningless because too much of the observed variation is measurement noise, not real process variation.
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 5**: A visual inspection has the following results: Kappa vs. reference = 0.72, within-operator agreement = 88%, between-operator agreement = 75%. Evaluate this attribute measurement system.</summary>

**Answer:**

**Results Interpretation:**

1. **Kappa vs. Reference = 0.72**
   - Falls in "Substantial agreement" range (0.61-0.80)
   - Operators are correctly classifying parts most of the time
   - Acceptable for many applications, but improvement possible

2. **Within-Operator Agreement = 88%**
   - Operators are fairly consistent with themselves
   - 12% of the time, same operator gives different result on same part
   - Should target >90% for critical inspections

3. **Between-Operator Agreement = 75%**
   - Operators disagree on 25% of parts
   - This is a significant reproducibility issue
   - Major source of inconsistency in product quality

**Assessment: MARGINAL - Improvement Needed**

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Standardize criteria**: Create clear visual standards with boundary samples
   - Photos of accept/reject borderline cases
   - Written descriptions of defect criteria

2. **Training**:
   - Calibration session with all operators and reference samples
   - Identify operators with lower agreement for targeted training

3. **Improve conditions**:
   - Check lighting adequacy and consistency
   - Ensure proper viewing distance and angle
   - Reduce fatigue with appropriate break schedules

4. **Consider automation**: For critical inspections, automated vision systems may provide better consistency

5. **Re-study after improvements** to verify effectiveness
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 6**: What is the "Rule of Ten" for gauge resolution, and how would you apply it?</summary>

**Answer:**

**The Rule of Ten:**
The gauge resolution should be at least **1/10 of the tolerance** or **1/10 of the process variation (6σ)**, whichever is smaller.

$$\text{Resolution} \leq \frac{\min(\text{Tolerance}, 6\sigma)}{10}$$

**Application Example:**

Given:
- Part tolerance: ±0.05 mm (total = 0.10 mm)
- Process 6σ: 0.08 mm
- Available gauges: 0.01 mm resolution, 0.001 mm resolution

**Calculation:**
```
Required resolution ≤ min(0.10, 0.08) / 10
Required resolution ≤ 0.08 / 10
Required resolution ≤ 0.008 mm
```

**Assessment:**
- 0.01 mm gauge: 0.01 > 0.008 → **INADEQUATE**
- 0.001 mm gauge: 0.001 < 0.008 → **ADEQUATE**

**Why It Matters:**
1. If resolution is too coarse, gauge cannot detect small part differences
2. Results in low ndc (number of distinct categories)
3. Control charts will show "stair-step" patterns
4. Capability studies will be inaccurate

**Practical Tips:**
- For SPC applications, 10:1 is minimum; 20:1 is preferred
- For capability studies, 10:1 is acceptable
- For simple pass/fail gauging, 5:1 may be acceptable
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 7**: Given the following ANOVA table from a Gauge R&R study, calculate the variance components and %GRR.</summary>

| Source | DF | SS | MS |
|--------|-----|------|-------|
| Part | 9 | 0.2850 | 0.03167 |
| Operator | 2 | 0.0025 | 0.00125 |
| Part×Operator | 18 | 0.0090 | 0.00050 |
| Repeatability | 60 | 0.0180 | 0.00030 |
| Total | 89 | 0.3145 | |

Study design: 10 parts, 3 operators, 3 trials

**Answer:**

```{r q7-answer, echo=TRUE}
# Given values from ANOVA table
MS_part <- 0.03167
MS_operator <- 0.00125
MS_interaction <- 0.00050
MS_error <- 0.00030

n_parts <- 10
n_operators <- 3
n_trials <- 3

# Variance components

cat("Var(Repeatability) =", var_repeatability, "\n")

var_interaction <- max(0, (MS_interaction - MS_error) / n_trials)

# Reproducibility = Operator + Interaction
var_reproducibility <- var_operator + var_interaction
cat("Var(Reproducibility) =", round(var_reproducibility, 6), "\n")

# Total Gauge R&R
var_GRR <- var_repeatability + var_reproducibility

pct_GRR <- (sigma_GRR / sigma_total) * 100

cat("%GRR (of Total Variation) =", round(pct_GRR, 1), "%\n\n")

# ndc
sigma_part <- sqrt(var_part)
ndc <- 1.41 * (sigma_part / sigma_GRR)

if(pct_GRR < 10) {
  cat("Assessment: ACCEPTABLE (< 10%)\n")
} else if(pct_GRR < 30) {
  cat("Assessment: MARGINAL (10-30%)\n")
} else {
  cat("Assessment: UNACCEPTABLE (> 30%)\n")
}
```
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 8**: What actions would you take if a Gauge R&R study showed high repeatability (EV) but low reproducibility (AV)?</summary>

**Answer:**

When **repeatability is high** (main contributor to GRR) but **reproducibility is low**, the measurement variation is coming from the gauge/equipment/technique rather than differences between operators.

**Root Cause Investigation - Focus Areas:**

1. **Gauge Condition**
   - Worn measuring surfaces or contacts
   - Loose components or mechanism play
   - Damaged or dirty probe/sensor

2. **Gauge Resolution**
   - Resolution may be inadequate for the tolerance
   - Check 10:1 rule compliance

3. **Fixture/Fixturing**
   - Part not held consistently
   - Fixture wear or damage
   - Part not seating properly

4. **Measurement Technique**
   - Inconsistent contact force
   - Varying measurement location on part
   - Speed of measurement varies

5. **Part Characteristics**
   - Part surface finish affecting readings
   - Part flexibility/deflection during measurement
   - Part temperature variation

6. **Environment**
   - Vibration affecting readings
   - Temperature instability
   - Contamination

**Improvement Actions:**

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Verify gauge calibration and condition; repair/replace if needed |
| 2 | Check and improve fixture; ensure consistent part positioning |
| 3 | Evaluate and potentially upgrade gauge resolution |
| 4 | Standardize technique (force, speed, location) |
| 5 | Control environmental factors |
| 6 | Re-run study to verify improvement |

**Note:** Low AV in this case is actually good - it means operators are consistent with each other. The problem is the measurement equipment itself.

<details><summary>**Understanding the Pyramid Levels**</summary>

**Level 0 - Process:** The actual physical equipment, machines, and processes being controlled. This includes conveyors, motors, valves, tanks, and the product being manufactured.

**Level 1 - Field Devices:** Sensors that measure process variables (temperature, pressure, flow, position) and actuators that affect the process (motors, valves, solenoids, drives).

**Level 2 - Control:** The "brain" of automation - PLCs, DCS, and motion controllers that execute control logic, process sensor inputs, and command actuators. Also includes HMI for operator interaction.

**Level 3 - Manufacturing Operations:** MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems), SCADA, production scheduling, quality management, and maintenance management. Bridges plant floor and business systems.

**Level 4 - Enterprise:** ERP systems, business intelligence, supply chain management, financial systems. Makes business decisions based on plant floor data.

**Key Principle:** Data flows up (process information), commands flow down (control directives).

<details><summary>**How the Start/Stop Circuit Works**</summary>

**Rung 1 - Motor Control:**
1. Power flows from L1 through the NC (Normally Closed) STOP button
2. If STOP is pressed, the circuit breaks and motor stops
3. START is NO (Normally Open) - pressing it allows power to flow to the MOTOR coil
4. When MOTOR energizes, its NO contact in the parallel branch closes
5. This "seals in" the circuit - motor stays running even after START is released
6. To stop, press STOP which breaks the seal-in circuit

**Rung 2 - Run Indicator:**
1. When MOTOR coil is energized, the MOTOR contact closes
2. This allows power to flow to the RUN LIGHT output
3. Light is ON whenever motor is running

**This is called a "3-wire control" circuit** - it provides:
- Low voltage release protection (motor won't restart after power failure)
- Maintained contact operation (don't need to hold START button)

## Review Questions

<details><summary>**Question 1**: Compare and contrast fixed, programmable, and flexible automation. Give an example application for each.</summary>

**Answer:**

| Aspect | Fixed | Programmable | Flexible |
|--------|-------|--------------|----------|
| Product variety | Single product | Batches of different products | High variety, mixed production |
| Volume | Very high | Medium-high | Low-medium |
| Changeover | Difficult, expensive | Hours to days | Minutes |
| Investment | Very high | High | Very high |
| Flexibility | None | Limited | High |

**Examples:**

1. **Fixed Automation**: Automotive transfer line producing engine blocks
   - Same machining operations repeated millions of times
   - Dedicated stations optimized for specific operations
   - Changing product would require complete retooling

2. **Programmable Automation**: CNC machining job shop
   - Different parts programmed and run in batches
   - Significant setup time between batches
   - Equipment reprogrammable but not instantaneous

3. **Flexible Automation**: Robotic welding cell in aerospace
   - Different assemblies run with quick changeover
   - Robot program changes automatically based on part ID
   - Same cell handles multiple product variants
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 2**: Explain the PLC scan cycle and why scan time is important.</summary>

**Answer:**

**The PLC Scan Cycle** consists of four main phases executed continuously:

1. **Input Scan** (~1ms): Read all physical inputs and store values in the input image table
2. **Program Execution** (~5-20ms): Execute the user program (ladder logic, etc.) using input image data
3. **Output Update** (~1ms): Write output image table values to physical outputs
4. **Housekeeping** (~1-3ms): Communications, diagnostics, self-testing

**Total scan time** = Sum of all phases, typically 10-50ms

**Why Scan Time Matters:**

1. **Response Time**: An input change isn't acted upon until the next scan completes. If scan time is 50ms, worst-case response time is 50ms.

2. **Safety**: Fast-moving machinery requires short scan times for safety functions. A 100ms scan time with a motor at 1800 RPM means 3 shaft revolutions between scans.

3. **Application Limits**:
   - Motion control may need <1ms scan times (special motion PLCs)
   - High-speed counting needs special modules
   - Safety PLCs have guaranteed maximum scan times

4. **Program Size Impact**: Larger programs take longer to execute, increasing scan time. Optimization may be needed for time-critical applications.

5. **Communication Delays**: Network updates typically happen once per scan, affecting data freshness.

<details><summary>**Question 3**: What are the key differences between PNP and NPN sensor outputs? When would you use each?</summary>

**Answer:**

**PNP (Sourcing):**
- Sensor output sources current TO the load
- When activated, output connects to +V
- Load is connected between sensor output and 0V
- Current flows: +V → Sensor → Output → Load → 0V
- Common in North America and Europe

**NPN (Sinking):**
- Sensor output sinks current FROM the load
- When activated, output connects to 0V (ground)
- Load is connected between sensor output and +V
- Current flows: +V → Load → Output → Sensor → 0V
- Common in Asia (Japan)

**Selection Criteria:**

1. **PLC Input Type**:
   - Sinking PLC inputs work with PNP (sourcing) sensors
   - Sourcing PLC inputs work with NPN (sinking) sensors

2. **Regional Standards**:
   - North America: PNP is standard
   - Europe: PNP is standard
   - Japan/Asia: NPN is common

3. **Safety Considerations**:
   - PNP: A ground fault can cause false ON signal
   - NPN: A ground fault typically causes safe-off condition
   - For safety applications, consider sensor design carefully

4. **Existing Infrastructure**:
   - Match new sensors to existing system type
   - Converting between types requires different PLC input cards

<details><summary>**Question 4**: A VFD is controlling a 10 HP, 4-pole motor rated at 1750 RPM and 460V at 60Hz. Calculate the motor speed at 30Hz and 45Hz. What voltage should the VFD supply at these frequencies?</summary>

**Answer:**

```{r q4-answer, echo=TRUE}
# Motor parameters
poles <- 4
rated_voltage <- 460  # V
rated_frequency <- 60  # Hz
rated_rpm <- 1750

# Calculate synchronous speed and slip at rated conditions
sync_speed_60 <- 120 * rated_frequency / poles
slip_rpm <- sync_speed_60 - rated_rpm
slip_percent <- (slip_rpm / sync_speed_60) * 100

cat("Motor Analysis:\n")
cat("Synchronous speed at 60Hz:", sync_speed_60, "RPM\n")
cat("Rated speed:", rated_rpm, "RPM\n")
cat("Slip:", slip_rpm, "RPM (", round(slip_percent, 1), "%)\n\n")

# V/Hz ratio
vhz_ratio <- rated_voltage / rated_frequency
cat("V/Hz Ratio:", round(vhz_ratio, 2), "V/Hz\n\n")

# Calculate at 30Hz
freq_30 <- 30
sync_30 <- 120 * freq_30 / poles
speed_30 <- sync_30 - slip_rpm  # Assuming constant slip in RPM
voltage_30 <- freq_30 * vhz_ratio

cat("At 30Hz:\n")
cat("  Synchronous speed:", sync_30, "RPM\n")
cat("  Motor speed (approx):", speed_30, "RPM\n")
cat("  VFD output voltage:", voltage_30, "V\n\n")

# Calculate at 45Hz
freq_45 <- 45
sync_45 <- 120 * freq_45 / poles
speed_45 <- sync_45 - slip_rpm
voltage_45 <- freq_45 * vhz_ratio

cat("At 45Hz:\n")
cat("  Synchronous speed:", sync_45, "RPM\n")
cat("  Motor speed (approx):", speed_45, "RPM\n")
cat("  VFD output voltage:", voltage_45, "V\n")
```

**Note:** The calculation assumes constant slip in RPM, which is an approximation. Actual slip varies somewhat with load and frequency. The V/Hz ratio is maintained constant to provide constant torque capability below base speed.
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 5**: Compare Ethernet/IP and PROFINET. When would you choose each?</summary>

**Answer:**

| Feature | Ethernet/IP | PROFINET |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Developer** | ODVA (Rockwell Automation) | PROFIBUS International (Siemens) |
| **Base Protocol** | CIP over TCP/UDP | Based on standard Ethernet |
| **Real-time** | CIP Motion for motion control | IRT (Isochronous Real-Time) |
| **Determinism** | Standard: non-deterministic; CIP Sync: deterministic | RT: soft real-time; IRT: hard real-time |
| **Typical Cycle** | 2-10ms (standard); <1ms (CIP Motion) | 1-10ms (RT); <1ms (IRT) |
| **Ecosystem** | Allen-Bradley, DeviceNet-heritage | Siemens, PROFIBUS-heritage |

**Choose Ethernet/IP when:**
- Using Allen-Bradley/Rockwell PLCs
- Integrating with DeviceNet legacy systems
- Standard industrial Ethernet needs
- North American installations (common)
- Need CIP protocol compatibility

**Choose PROFINET when:**
- Using Siemens PLCs (S7-1200, S7-1500)
- Migrating from PROFIBUS installations
- Need IRT for high-performance motion
- European installations (common)
- Require I-Device functionality

**General Guidance:**
- Match the protocol to your PLC vendor's ecosystem
- Both are capable industrial Ethernet solutions
- Consider existing infrastructure and expertise
- For motion, evaluate specific timing requirements
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 6**: What is the difference between HMI and SCADA? Where would each be used?</summary>

**Answer:**

**HMI (Human-Machine Interface):**
- Local operator interface for a single machine or process
- Typically a touchscreen panel mounted on or near equipment
- Communicates directly with one or few PLCs
- Provides real-time control and monitoring
- Limited data storage (trends, alarms)
- Examples: Allen-Bradley PanelView, Siemens Comfort Panel

**SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition):**
- Centralized system monitoring multiple processes/locations
- Server-based architecture with multiple client workstations
- Communicates with many PLCs/RTUs across large distances
- Supervisory control - high-level commands, not direct control
- Extensive historical data collection and analysis
- Examples: Wonderware, Ignition, FactoryTalk View SE

**Where Each is Used:**

| Application | HMI | SCADA |
|-------------|-----|-------|
| Single CNC machine | ✓ | |
| Packaging line | ✓ | |
| Entire factory floor | | ✓ |
| Water treatment plant | ✓ (local) | ✓ (central) |
| Oil pipeline network | | ✓ |
| Building automation | ✓ (per zone) | ✓ (campus-wide) |
| Power grid | | ✓ |

**Key Distinction:** HMI is typically embedded/local for one process; SCADA is a system supervising many processes across the enterprise.

<details><summary>**Question 7**: Explain what SIL 3 means and give an example of a SIL 3 application.</summary>

**Answer:**

**SIL 3 (Safety Integrity Level 3)** is defined in IEC 61508 and represents:

- **PFD (Probability of Failure on Demand):** 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻³ (0.01% to 0.1%)
- **Risk Reduction Factor:** 1,000 to 10,000
- **Availability:** 99.9% to 99.99%

**What SIL 3 Means:**
- The safety function will fail to operate when needed less than 1 in 1,000 demands
- Requires redundant architecture (typically 2oo3 or 1oo2D)
- Requires certified safety-rated components
- Requires rigorous design, testing, and validation processes
- Requires regular proof testing and maintenance

**SIL 3 Requirements:**
- Hardware fault tolerance ≥ 1 (single fault won't cause dangerous failure)
- Safe Failure Fraction > 90% (for Type A components)
- Systematic capability rating of SC3
- Extensive documentation and lifecycle management

**SIL 3 Application Examples:**

1. **Emergency Shutdown System (ESD)** in oil refinery
   - Detects dangerous conditions (high pressure, fire)
   - Shuts down process and isolates fuel sources
   - Failure could result in explosion and fatalities

2. **Burner Management System (BMS)**
   - Controls furnace/boiler ignition sequence
   - Monitors flame presence and fuel/air ratio
   - Prevents furnace explosions

3. **High Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS)**
   - Prevents overpressure in pipelines
   - Isolates high-pressure source before relief valve capacity exceeded
   - Protects against catastrophic pipeline rupture
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 8**: Describe three benefits of implementing IIoT in a manufacturing facility and give a specific example of each.</summary>

**Answer:**

**1. Predictive Maintenance**

*Benefit:* Detect equipment degradation before failure, enabling planned maintenance during scheduled downtime rather than emergency repairs.

*Example:* Vibration sensors on a conveyor gearbox transmit data to cloud analytics. Machine learning algorithms detect bearing wear signature 3 weeks before expected failure. Maintenance schedules replacement during next planned shutdown, avoiding $50,000 in lost production from unplanned downtime.

**2. Real-Time Production Visibility**

*Benefit:* Instant access to production metrics, OEE, and quality data from anywhere, enabling faster decision-making.

*Example:* Dashboard shows real-time OEE for all production lines on plant manager's tablet. Sudden drop in Line 3 performance triggers alert. Investigation reveals material feed issue; corrected within 30 minutes instead of waiting for end-of-shift report.

**3. Energy Optimization**

*Benefit:* Monitor energy consumption at machine level, identify waste, and optimize based on production schedule.

*Example:* Power meters on each machine report to central system. Analysis reveals HVAC in unused areas runs at full capacity during weekends. Automated scheduling reduces weekend HVAC operation, saving 15% on energy bills ($30,000/year).

**Additional Benefits:**

4. **Quality Traceability** - Every part traced through production with complete process data
5. **Remote Monitoring** - Engineers can diagnose issues without traveling to site
6. **Supply Chain Integration** - Real-time inventory and production data shared with suppliers

## ISO 9001:2015 Structure

**ISO 9001:2015** is the international standard for quality management systems. It uses the High-Level Structure (HLS) common to all ISO management system standards.

### The Ten Clauses

```{r iso-clauses, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=9}
clauses <- data.frame(
  clause = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10"),
  title = c("Scope", "Normative References", "Terms and Definitions",
            "Context of the Organization", "Leadership", "Planning",
            "Support", "Operation", "Performance Evaluation", "Improvement"),
  description = c(
    "Defines applicability of the standard",
    "References to ISO 9000:2015",
    "Definitions used in the standard",
    "Understanding the organization and its context",
    "Top management commitment and policy",
    "Actions to address risks and opportunities",
    "Resources, competence, awareness, communication",
    "Operational planning and control",
    "Monitoring, measurement, analysis, evaluation",
    "Nonconformity, corrective action, continual improvement"
  ),
  type = c("Intro", "Intro", "Intro", "Core", "Core", "Core",
           "Core", "Core", "Core", "Core"),
  y = c(10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
)

ggplot(clauses, aes(x = 1, y = y)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = type), width = 4, height = 0.8, color = "white", size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(x = -0.3, label = clause), fontface = "bold", size = 5, color = "#2c3e50") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 0.3, label = title), fontface = "bold", size = 3.5, hjust = 0, color = "white") +

    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )
```

### The Process Approach and PDCA

ISO 9001:2015 emphasizes the **process approach** combined with the **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)** cycle:

```{r pdca-cycle, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=8}
ggplot() +
  # PDCA circle

  annotate("path",
           x = 5 + 3 * cos(seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)),
           y = 5 + 3 * sin(seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)),
           color = "gray70", size = 2) +

  # Plan quadrant
  annotate("path",
           x = 5 + 3 * cos(seq(pi/2, pi, length.out = 50)),
           y = 5 + 3 * sin(seq(pi/2, pi, length.out = 50)),
           color = "#3498db", size = 4) +

### Risk-Based Thinking

ISO 9001:2015 introduced **risk-based thinking** throughout the QMS:

```{r risk-based, echo=FALSE}
risk_table <- data.frame(
  Clause = c("4.1", "4.2", "6.1", "8.1", "9.1", "10.2"),
  Requirement = c(
    "Context of the Organization",
    "Interested Parties",
    "Actions to Address Risks and Opportunities",
    "Operational Planning and Control",
    "Monitoring and Measurement",
    "Nonconformity and Corrective Action"
  ),
  Risk_Application = c(
    "Identify internal/external issues that could affect QMS outcomes",
    "Understand needs/expectations that could impact quality",
    "Plan actions to address risks and opportunities; integrate into processes",
    "Control processes considering risks identified in planning",
    "Monitor effectiveness of actions taken to address risks",
    "Analyze nonconformities; update risks/opportunities as needed"
  )
)

kable(risk_table, caption = "Risk-Based Thinking in ISO 9001:2015") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "10%") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "25%")
```

<details><summary>**Understanding Risk-Based Thinking**</summary>

**Risk-based thinking** doesn't require formal risk management (like FMEA for every process), but rather:

1. **Consider risks** when designing and implementing the QMS
2. **Preventive action** is built into the system, not a separate activity
3. **Proportional response** - more rigorous controls for higher-risk processes
4. **Opportunities** are also considered (not just negative risks)

**Example:** A food manufacturer identifies "allergen cross-contamination" as a significant risk. Risk-based thinking leads them to:
- Dedicated production lines for allergen-containing products
- Enhanced cleaning verification procedures
- Staff training on allergen awareness
- Increased inspection frequency after changeovers

The extent of controls is proportional to the risk level.

## Industry-Specific Quality Standards

Different industries have developed standards that build upon ISO 9001 with additional sector-specific requirements.

### Comparison of Major Standards

```{r standards-comparison, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=7}
standards <- data.frame(
  Standard = c("ISO 9001:2015", "IATF 16949:2016", "AS9100D", "ISO 22000:2018"),

  Base = c("Standalone", "ISO 9001 + Automotive", "ISO 9001 + Aerospace", "ISO 9001 + HACCP"),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  y = c(1, 1, 1, 1)

### IATF 16949:2016 (Automotive)

**IATF 16949** is the automotive quality standard, required by most major OEMs (Ford, GM, Toyota, VW, etc.).

```{r iatf-additions, echo=FALSE}
iatf_requirements <- data.frame(
  Area = c("Product Safety", "APQP/PPAP", "Control Plans", "MSA", "SPC",

  column_spec(2, background = "#fadbd8") %>%
  column_spec(3, background = "#d5f5e3")
```

### Automotive Core Tools

IATF 16949 requires the use of **five core tools**:

```{r core-tools, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
core_tools <- data.frame(
  tool = c("APQP", "PPAP", "FMEA", "MSA", "SPC"),

  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "25%")
```

### ISO 22000:2018 (Food Safety)

**ISO 22000** integrates quality management with **HACCP** (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points):

```{r iso22000-structure, echo=FALSE}

- Notification to auditee
- Defined scope and objectives

**4. Audit Execution**
- Opening meeting (purpose, scope, schedule)
- Evidence collection (documents, records, interviews, observation)
- Objective evaluation against criteria
- Note taking and evidence documentation

**5. Reporting**
- Clear finding statements (nonconformities, observations)
- Reference to requirement violated
- Objective evidence cited
- Closing meeting to present findings

**6. Follow-up**
- Corrective action requests issued
- Root cause analysis required
- Verification of corrective action implementation
- Verification of effectiveness

**7. Continuous Improvement of Audit Program**
- Evaluate audit program effectiveness

- Calibrate auditors periodically
- Incorporate lessons learned
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 5**: Explain the difference between corrective action and preventive action. Provide an example of each.</summary>

**Answer:**

**Corrective Action:**
- Eliminates the cause of a *detected* nonconformity
- Reactive - responds to something that has already happened
- Goal: Prevent recurrence of the specific problem

*Example:*
- **Nonconformity:** Customer received shipment with wrong part numbers (3 incidents in past month)
- **Root Cause:** Shipping labels printed from outdated part number list
- **Corrective Action:**
  1. Update master part number list
  2. Link shipping system directly to ERP for current data
  3. Add verification step comparing label to packing list
- **Verification:** No recurrence after 3 months

**Preventive Action:**
- Eliminates the cause of a *potential* nonconformity
- Proactive - addresses something that hasn't happened yet
- Goal: Prevent occurrence before it happens

*Example:*
- **Potential Nonconformity:** New CNC machine may produce out-of-spec parts due to operator unfamiliarity
- **Risk Identified Through:** PFMEA analysis during new equipment installation
- **Preventive Action:**
  1. Develop comprehensive training program before machine goes live
  2. Create detailed setup procedures with photos
  3. Implement first-article inspection for first 30 days
  4. Assign experienced mentor to new operators
- **Verification:** Track first-pass yield during initial production period

**Key Difference:**
- Corrective = Fix what went wrong
- Preventive = Stop what might go wrong

**Note:** ISO 9001:2015 doesn't explicitly require "preventive action" as a separate process. Instead, risk-based thinking throughout the QMS serves the preventive function.

<details><summary>**Question 6**: Calculate and analyze the Cost of Quality for the following data. What recommendations would you make?</summary>

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Quality planning | $35,000 |
| Training | $25,000 |
| Incoming inspection | $40,000 |
| In-process inspection | $55,000 |
| Final inspection | $30,000 |
| Scrap | $85,000 |
| Rework | $65,000 |
| Warranty claims | $120,000 |
| Customer returns | $45,000 |

Annual revenue: $8,000,000

**Answer:**

```{r q6-answer, echo=TRUE}
# Cost of Quality Analysis
prevention <- 35000 + 25000  # Planning + Training
appraisal <- 40000 + 55000 + 30000  # Inspections
internal_failure <- 85000 + 65000  # Scrap + Rework
external_failure <- 120000 + 45000  # Warranty + Returns

total_coq <- prevention + appraisal + internal_failure + external_failure
revenue <- 8000000

cat("Cost of Quality Breakdown:\n")
cat("─────────────────────────────\n")
cat("Prevention:       $", format(prevention, big.mark = ","),
    "(", round(prevention/total_coq*100, 1), "%)\n")
cat("Appraisal:        $", format(appraisal, big.mark = ","),
    "(", round(appraisal/total_coq*100, 1), "%)\n")
cat("Internal Failure: $", format(internal_failure, big.mark = ","),
    "(", round(internal_failure/total_coq*100, 1), "%)\n")
cat("External Failure: $", format(external_failure, big.mark = ","),
    "(", round(external_failure/total_coq*100, 1), "%)\n")
cat("─────────────────────────────\n")
cat("Total COQ:        $", format(total_coq, big.mark = ","), "\n")
cat("COQ % of Revenue:", round(total_coq/revenue*100, 1), "%\n\n")

conformance <- prevention + appraisal
nonconformance <- internal_failure + external_failure

cat("Conformance Costs:    $", format(conformance, big.mark = ","),
    "(", round(conformance/total_coq*100, 1), "%)\n")
cat("Nonconformance Costs: $", format(nonconformance, big.mark = ","),
    "(", round(nonconformance/total_coq*100, 1), "%)\n")
```

**Analysis:**
- COQ at 7.5% of revenue is HIGH (target <3%)
- External failure costs are the largest category (27.5%)
- Nonconformance costs (60.8%) greatly exceed conformance (39.2%)
- Prevention is only 10% of COQ - very low

**Recommendations:**
1. **Increase Prevention Investment:**
   - Implement SPC on critical processes to reduce defects
   - Enhance operator training on quality standards
   - Apply PFMEA to identify and control failure modes

2. **Reduce External Failures:**
   - Analyze warranty data for root causes
   - Improve final inspection effectiveness
   - Implement containment for known issues

3. **Optimize Appraisal:**
   - Use SPC to reduce inspection where processes are capable
   - Implement risk-based inspection (more for critical, less for proven)

4. **Target COQ Reduction:**
   - Short-term: Reduce external failures by 50% ($82,500 savings)
   - Medium-term: Reduce internal failures by 30% ($45,000 savings)
   - Long-term: Achieve COQ <3% of revenue ($240,000)
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 7**: What is risk-based thinking in ISO 9001:2015? How is it different from formal risk management?</summary>

**Answer:**

**Risk-Based Thinking in ISO 9001:2015:**

Risk-based thinking is a way of considering risks and opportunities when designing, implementing, and operating the QMS. It:

- Applies throughout the standard (not a separate clause)
- Is proportional to potential impact on conformity
- Makes preventive action part of routine planning
- Considers both risks (negative) and opportunities (positive)

**Where Risk-Based Thinking Applies:**

| Clause | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| 4.1 Context | Identify external/internal issues affecting QMS |
| 4.2 Interested Parties | Understand requirements that could impact quality |
| 6.1 Planning | Plan actions to address risks and opportunities |
| 8.1 Operations | Consider risks in operational planning |
| 9.1 Performance | Monitor effectiveness of risk actions |
| 10.2 Corrective Action | Update risks/opportunities based on nonconformities |

**How It Differs from Formal Risk Management:**

| Aspect | Risk-Based Thinking | Formal Risk Management |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Requirement | Implicit throughout ISO 9001 | Explicit (ISO 31000) |
| Documentation | No formal risk register required | Documented risk register |
| Methodology | No specific method required | Defined methodology (FMEA, etc.) |
| Quantification | Not required | Often quantitative |
| Scope | QMS processes | Enterprise-wide |

**Practical Implementation:**

Organizations should:
1. Consider risks when designing processes
2. Build controls proportional to risk level
3. Monitor and review effectiveness
4. Update as context changes

ISO 9001 does NOT require:
- Formal risk management process
- Risk register
- Specific risk assessment methodology
- Documented risk assessments (unless organization decides to)

However, many organizations do use tools like PFMEA to fulfill risk-based thinking requirements, especially in automotive (IATF 16949 requires it).
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 8**: Describe what management review is and what should be included in the inputs and outputs.</summary>

**Answer:**

**What is Management Review?**

Management review is a formal, periodic evaluation of the QMS by top management to:
- Ensure continuing suitability (appropriate for the organization)
- Ensure adequacy (sufficient to meet requirements)
- Ensure effectiveness (achieving intended results)
- Ensure alignment with strategic direction
- Identify improvement opportunities

**Frequency:** At least annually; many organizations conduct quarterly reviews

**Required Inputs (ISO 9001 Clause 9.3.2):**

| Input | What to Review |
|-------|----------------|
| Status of previous actions | Actions from prior reviews - completed? effective? |
| Changes in external/internal issues | Market changes, regulations, technology, organizational changes |
| QMS performance and effectiveness | Customer satisfaction, quality objectives, process performance, nonconformities, audit results, supplier performance |
| Resource adequacy | People, infrastructure, environment, knowledge |
| Effectiveness of risk actions | Did actions address risks/opportunities? |
| Improvement opportunities | Suggestions, benchmarking, new technologies |

**Required Outputs (ISO 9001 Clause 9.3.3):**

| Output | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Improvement decisions | Launch specific improvement projects, address recurring issues |
| QMS changes | Revise quality objectives, update processes, modify documentation |
| Resource needs | Budget approvals, hiring, equipment purchases, training |

**Best Practices:**
- Use a standard agenda aligned with required inputs
- Prepare data in advance (dashboards, trend charts)
- Document decisions and action items with owners and due dates
- Follow up on action completion
- Keep minutes as quality records

**Evidence Required:**
- Meeting minutes or management review report
- Attendance record (top management participation)
- Action items with status tracking
- Data/reports presented

<details><summary>**Understanding the Difference**</summary>

**Repeatability:**
- Ability to return to the SAME taught position
- More important for most applications
- Quoted spec (e.g., ±0.05mm) is typically 3σ
- Achieved through consistent mechanical design and servo control

**Accuracy:**
- Ability to reach a COMMANDED position
- Important for offline programming
- Affected by mechanical tolerances, deflection, calibration
- Can be improved through calibration

**Why Repeatability Matters More:**
In most applications, the robot is taught positions by jogging to them. As long as it returns to those positions consistently (repeatability), accuracy doesn't matter. Accuracy only matters when positions are calculated (offline programming) rather than taught.

## Review Questions

<details><summary>**Question 1**: Compare articulated (6-axis) robots, SCARA robots, and delta robots. For each, describe the typical applications and key advantages.</summary>

**Answer:**

| Robot Type | Configuration | Key Advantages | Typical Applications |
|------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **6-Axis Articulated** | 6 revolute joints; human-like arm | Maximum flexibility; can reach any orientation; large payload range | Welding, painting, assembly, material handling, machine tending |
| **SCARA** | 4 axes; selective compliance | Very fast horizontal motion; rigid vertical; compact; precise | Pick-and-place, assembly, screw driving, packaging |
| **Delta (Parallel)** | 3-4 axes; parallel linkage | Extremely fast (150+ picks/min); low moving mass | High-speed picking, packaging, sorting, light assembly |

**Detailed Comparison:**

**6-Axis Articulated:**
- Most versatile - can position tool at any angle
- Wide payload range (3 kg to 2300+ kg)
- Can reach around obstacles
- Complex programming possible
- *Best for:* Tasks requiring complex orientations, welding seams, painting

**SCARA:**
- Inherently rigid in Z (vertical) - good for insertion
- Very fast in X-Y plane
- Lower cost than 6-axis
- Compact footprint
- *Best for:* Assembly operations, circuit board population, packaging

**Delta:**
- Highest speed of any configuration
- Low inertia (motors at base, not moving)
- Limited payload (typically <15 kg)
- Requires overhead mounting
- *Best for:* High-speed sorting, packaging lines, food handling
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 2**: A robot has a maximum payload of 15 kg. The gripper weighs 4 kg and the part weighs 8 kg. Is this robot suitable? What other factors should be considered?</summary>

**Answer:**

**Initial Assessment:**
```
Total load = Gripper weight + Part weight
Total load = 4 kg + 8 kg = 12 kg

Robot capacity: 15 kg
Load: 12 kg
Remaining margin: 3 kg (20%)
```

**Consideration with Safety Factor:**
```
Typical safety factor: 1.2 - 1.5
Required capacity = 12 kg × 1.25 = 15 kg

This equals the robot's maximum capacity - marginal!
```

**Additional Factors to Consider:**

1. **Moment Load (Torque at Wrist)**
   - Distance from flange to center of gravity matters
   - If part is held 300mm from flange: Moment = 8 kg × 0.3 m = 2.4 kg·m
   - Robot specs include moment limits - must verify

2. **Inertia**
   - Fast motion requires acceleration
   - Higher mass + longer distance = higher inertia
   - May need to derate payload for high-speed applications

3. **Payload Derating with Reach**
   - Many robots derate payload at extended reach
   - 15 kg at 500mm may become 10 kg at 1500mm
   - Check payload diagram in robot specifications

4. **Orientation**
   - Payload may vary with wrist orientation
   - Horizontal reach vs. vertical lift differ

5. **Acceleration Requirements**
   - Higher acceleration = higher effective load
   - May need to reduce speed/acceleration

**Recommendation:**
The 15 kg robot is marginal for this application. Consider:
- Select next size up (20 kg) for adequate margin
- Use lighter gripper (3 kg or less)
- Reduce part handling distance from flange
- Limit acceleration/speed if using this robot
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 3**: Explain the difference between repeatability and accuracy. Why is repeatability often more important than accuracy for robot applications?</summary>

**Answer:**

**Definitions:**

**Repeatability:**
- Ability to return to the **same taught position** multiple times
- Measures consistency/precision of motion
- Quoted as ± value (e.g., ±0.05 mm at 3σ)
- Affected by: mechanical wear, servo control, thermal effects

**Accuracy:**
- Ability to reach a **commanded position** exactly
- Measures how close actual position is to theoretical position
- Typically worse than repeatability (e.g., ±0.5 mm)
- Affected by: manufacturing tolerances, calibration, deflection, backlash

**Why Repeatability is Usually More Important:**

1. **Teaching Method**
   - Most robots are programmed by teaching (jogging to positions)
   - Robot doesn't need to know where it "should" be - just return to where it was taught
   - As long as it returns consistently (repeatability), accuracy doesn't matter

2. **Process Requirements**
   - Welding: Need to follow same seam every time → repeatability
   - Assembly: Need to insert part in same hole every time → repeatability
   - Pick-place: Need to pick from same fixture position → repeatability

3. **Compensation Possible**
   - Poor accuracy can be compensated by adjusting taught points
   - Poor repeatability cannot be compensated

**When Accuracy Matters:**

1. **Offline Programming**
   - Positions calculated from CAD data, not taught
   - Robot must go where commanded, first time
   - Common in aerospace (large parts, tight access)

2. **Multi-Robot Systems**
   - Robots must agree on positions
   - Calibration to common frame requires accuracy

3. **Frequent Program Changes**
   - If programs are frequently changed without re-teaching
   - Offline modifications need accurate execution

**Bottom Line:**
For most industrial applications, ±0.05 mm repeatability is far more valuable than ±0.5 mm accuracy because taught positions are used.

<details><summary>**Question 4**: Describe the four collaborative operation modes defined in ISO/TS 15066. Give an example application for each.</summary>

**Answer:**

**1. Safety-Rated Monitored Stop**

*Description:* Robot operates at normal speed when workspace is clear. When a person enters the collaborative zone, the robot stops and holds position. Robot resumes automatically when person exits.

*Technical Requirements:*
- Safety-rated sensors (light curtains, scanners)
- Safety-rated monitored stop function
- Clearly defined collaborative zone

*Example Application:* Machine tending cell where operator occasionally loads raw material. Robot works at full speed during machining cycle but stops safely when operator enters to load/unload.

---

**2. Hand Guiding**

*Description:* Operator physically contacts the robot through a hand guiding device and manually moves it. Robot follows operator's force input.

*Technical Requirements:*
- Hand guiding device (force/torque sensing)
- Emergency stop accessible at guiding device
- Speed reduction while guiding
- Safe torque control

*Example Application:* Teaching a paint path on an aerospace component. Operator guides robot along surface contour while robot records positions. Also used for "collaborative finishing" where operator guides robot holding a polishing tool.

---

**3. Speed and Separation Monitoring**

*Description:* Robot continuously monitors distance to the nearest person. Speed adjusts based on separation: full speed when far, reduced speed when closer, stop if minimum distance breached.

*Technical Requirements:*
- Safety-rated distance monitoring (usually area scanners)
- Safety-rated speed control
- Multiple speed/distance zones defined
- Real-time separation calculation

*Example Application:* Shared packaging area where robot palletizes cases while operator moves around the cell. Robot slows when operator approaches, stops if too close, and resumes at appropriate speed as operator moves away.

---

**4. Power and Force Limiting**

*Description:* Robot is designed so that forces and pressures from any contact are below injury thresholds. Contact is allowed because it cannot cause harm.

*Technical Requirements:*
- Inherently safe design (compliant joints, low mass, rounded surfaces)
- Force/torque sensing or current monitoring
- Verified force limits per ISO/TS 15066 body area tables
- May include padding/soft covers

*Example Application:* Assembly assist where robot holds a heavy part while human worker installs fasteners. Robot and human are in direct contact, with robot providing position support and human providing dexterity. Force is limited so accidental contact causes no injury.

<details><summary>**Question 5**: Calculate the required gripper force for a robot picking a 2 kg part with a friction coefficient of 0.4. The robot accelerates at 10 m/s². Use a safety factor of 2.0.</summary>

**Answer:**

```{r q5-answer, echo=TRUE}
# Given values
mass <- 2.0            # kg
acceleration <- 10     # m/s²

- Placed in hazardous zones
- Withstand industrial environment (oil, debris)
- Fast response
- Self-monitoring for failures

*Application:* Areas where overhead detection isn't practical; around robot bases.

---

**4. Area Scanners (Safety Laser Scanners)**

*Description:* Laser scanner detects objects/personnel entering defined zones. Multiple warning and stop zones configurable.

*Characteristics:*
- 270° field of view typical
- Multiple programmable zones
- Warning zone (slow robot) and stop zone (stop robot)
- Type 3 safety rating
- Detects at floor level

*Application:* Open cells requiring flexibility; mobile robot protection; speed/separation monitoring.

---

**5. Interlocked Gates/Doors**

*Description:* Access gates with safety switches that stop robot when opened.

*Characteristics:*
- Mechanical or magnetic interlock switches
- Trapped key systems for lockout
- May include guard locking (prevent opening while robot moving)
- Escape release from inside
- Meets ISO 14119

*Application:* Authorized entry points for maintenance, setup, troubleshooting.

---

**Additional Devices:**

</details>

<details><summary>**Question 7**: Explain the difference between MoveJ (Joint Move) and MoveL (Linear Move). When would you use each?</summary>

**Answer:**

**MoveJ (Joint Move)**

*How It Works:*
- Each joint moves from start to end angle independently
- All joints start and stop together (coordinated)
- Path of TCP (Tool Center Point) is unpredictable - curved
- Robot calculates joint interpolation, not TCP path

*Characteristics:*
- Fastest point-to-point motion
- No singularity issues during move
- Path may vary depending on starting configuration
- Speed specified in % of max or joint velocity (°/s)

*When to Use:*
- Moving between distant points through free space
- Approach movements before precise positioning
- Home position moves
- Any time when path doesn't matter, only endpoints
- Escaping from near-singularity positions

---

**MoveL (Linear Move)**

*How It Works:*
- TCP follows a straight line from start to end
- Robot calculates joint positions to maintain linear TCP path
- Orientation is interpolated linearly as well
- All axes coordinated to produce straight line

*Characteristics:*
- Guaranteed straight path
- Consistent, predictable motion
- Slower than MoveJ for same endpoint distance
- Can encounter singularities during move
- Speed specified in mm/s at TCP

*When to Use:*
- Process paths (welding, sealing, cutting)
- Insertion/extraction operations
- Approach to pick/place positions
- Any time path must be straight
- When moving close to obstacles

---

**Practical Example:**

Imagine picking a part from a fixture:

```
! Move from home to near pick position - path doesn't matter
MoveJ pApproach, v1000, z50, tool1    ! Joint move - fast

! Move down to pick - must be straight to avoid collision
MoveL pPick, v100, fine, tool1        ! Linear move - controlled

! Pick part, then retract straight up
GripperClose()
MoveL pApproach, v200, z10, tool1     ! Linear move - straight up

! Move to place area - through open space
MoveJ pPlaceApproach, v1000, z50, tool1  ! Joint move - fast
```

**Key Decision:**
- If path matters → MoveL
- If only destination matters → MoveJ
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 8**: A manufacturing engineer needs to select a robot for a palletizing application. The requirements are: 25 kg payload, 2.2 m horizontal reach, 10 cycles per minute, floor-mounted. Recommend a robot type and justify your selection.</summary>

**Answer:**

**Application Analysis:**

| Requirement | Value | Implication |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Payload | 25 kg | Medium-heavy; rules out delta and most SCARA |
| Reach | 2.2 m | Large work envelope needed |
| Cycle rate | 10/min | 6 seconds/cycle; moderate speed |
| Mounting | Floor | Typical industrial installation |
| Motion type | Palletizing | Mainly vertical and horizontal; some rotation |

**Robot Type Evaluation:**

**1. 4-Axis Palletizing Robot (RECOMMENDED)**
- Specifically designed for palletizing
- 4 axes: base rotation, arm, elbow, wrist
- High payload capability (25-700+ kg available)
- Long reach available (up to 3.2m)
- Fast for palletizing motions
- Lower cost than 6-axis
- Examples: FANUC M-410iC, KUKA KR QUANTEC PA, ABB IRB 460

*Verdict: Excellent match for this application*

**2. 6-Axis Articulated Robot**
- Maximum flexibility
- Can handle complex pallet patterns
- Higher cost than 4-axis for same payload
- May be over-specified for simple palletizing
- Examples: FANUC M-710iC/50, ABB IRB 6700

*Verdict: Capable but potentially over-specified and more expensive*

**3. Cartesian/Gantry Robot**
- Can cover very large areas
- Simple motion control
- Higher installation complexity
- Less common for palletizing applications

*Verdict: Possible but not ideal for this payload/cycle rate*

**Recommended Selection:**

**FANUC M-410iC/185** or similar 4-axis palletizer
- Payload: 185 kg (well above 25 kg requirement with margin for gripper)
- Reach: 3.143 m (exceeds 2.2 m requirement)
- Repeatability: ±0.5 mm
- Axes: 4

**Justification:**
1. **Purpose-built**: Designed specifically for palletizing
2. **Adequate payload**: 185 kg allows for heavy gripper + multiple parts
3. **Reach**: 3.1 m provides margin for future needs
4. **Speed**: Optimized kinematics for palletizing motion profile
5. **Reliability**: Proven in thousands of palletizing applications
6. **Cost**: Lower than equivalent 6-axis robot
7. **Simplicity**: 4 axes easier to program and maintain than 6

**Additional Recommendations:**
- Vacuum or mechanical gripper depending on product
- Vision system for product detection if variety exists
- Safety scanner for operator access during pallet changes
- Interface to conveyor for product delivery
