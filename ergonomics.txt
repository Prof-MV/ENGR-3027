• Case study of Ergonomics in Automated ManufacturingWhat is Ergonomics
o Ergonomics is a scientific discipline focused on understanding
the interactions between humans and other elements of a
system, with a view to optimize human well-being and overall
system performance.
o In industrial settings, ergonomics revolves around designing
workstations, machinery, and processes that consider human
capabilities and limitations.
o This design approach enhances operational efficiency and
safety while reducing the risk of workplace injuries.Common Risk factors
Ref: The Seven (7) Ergonomic Risk Factors to be assessed in the Initial Ergonomic Risk Assessment (INERA)Musculoskeletal DisordersWhat can be done to prevent MSDs?
• Maintain Neutral Posture
• Prevent excessive repetition
• Adjust work surfaces
• Avoid reaching
• Control environmental factors
• Reduce eye strain
• Lift properly
• Take time to recover
• Understand risk factors
• Know the signsHow can employers protect workers
• Provide management support
• Involve workers
• Provide training
• Identify problems
• Encourage early reporting of MSDs symptoms
• Implement solutions to control hazards
• Evaluate progressIndustry Specific Guidelines and Resources

Inseer - AI-Powered Ergonomics Assessment SoftwareThe Intersection of Ergonomics and
Industrial Automation
o Industrial automation inherently involves the mechanization of
processes traditionally carried out by human operators. In the
automation design phase, engineers must strike a balance
between mechanization and the necessary human interaction
with these systems.
o This is where ergonomics plays an integral role. By
incorporating ergonomic principles, designers can ensure that
the interaction between humans and automated systems is
seamless, effective, and safe.Ergonomic Design Principles
• Ergonomic design principles are based on the idea of making the human body more comfortable and
productive by reducing strain and fatigue.
• Neutral posture: Promote natural, balanced positions to reduce strain on the body
• Accommodate People’s different dimensions: Different people working on the same tasks may need
different work conditions. Engineering Design should accommodate the need of different people’s different
dimensionality needs. Example –right hand vs. left hand person.
• Reduce excessive force: Reduce the forces, frequencies, and durations of movements required to complete
a task
• Reduce excess motions: Reduce extreme joint motion, excessive force magnitudes, and highly repetitive
movements
• Optimize work area height: Optimize the heights of countertops, work surfaces, and appliances to reduce
bending, reaching, and straining
• Reduce static load: Minimize fatigue caused by static load, which occurs when workers have to hold the
same position for a long period
• Provide good environmental conditions: Create a comfortable and supportive workspaceProduction Ergonomics
