## Introduction to Troubleshooting

**Troubleshooting** is the systematic process of identifying, diagnosing, and resolving problems in equipment, processes, or systems. For electromechanical technicians, effective troubleshooting is perhaps the most valuable skill you can develop.

### The Cost of Downtime

Equipment failures and process problems have significant financial impacts:

```{r downtime-costs, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
industry_data <- data.frame(
  Industry = c("Automotive", "Food Processing", "Aerospace/Defense",
               "Pharmaceutical", "Oil & Gas"),
  Cost_Per_Hour = c(22000, 15000, 35000, 25000, 50000),
  Avg_Downtime_Hours = c(4, 6, 8, 5, 12)
)

industry_data$Total_Cost <- industry_data$Cost_Per_Hour * industry_data$Avg_Downtime_Hours

ggplot(industry_data, aes(x = reorder(Industry, Cost_Per_Hour), y = Cost_Per_Hour)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue", width = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0("$", format(Cost_Per_Hour, big.mark = ","))),
            hjust = -0.1, size = 4) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(), limits = c(0, 60000)) +
  labs(title = "Average Cost of Unplanned Downtime by Industry",
       subtitle = "Per hour of production stoppage",
       x = "",
       y = "Cost per Hour (USD)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 11)
  )
```

### Reactive vs. Proactive Problem Solving

```{r reactive-proactive, echo=FALSE}
approach_comparison <- data.frame(
  Aspect = c("Timing", "Focus", "Stress Level", "Cost", "Learning", "Documentation"),
  Reactive = c("After failure occurs", "Quick fix to restore operation",
               "High - production pressure", "High - emergency repairs",
               "Limited - rush to fix", "Often skipped"),
  Proactive = c("Before or early in failure", "Root cause elimination",
                "Lower - planned approach", "Lower - scheduled work",
                "High - thorough analysis", "Systematic and complete")
)

kable(approach_comparison, col.names = c("Aspect", "Reactive Approach", "Proactive Approach"),
      caption = "Comparison of Problem-Solving Approaches") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "15%") %>%
  column_spec(2, background = "#ffcccc", width = "42%") %>%
  column_spec(3, background = "#ccffcc", width = "43%")
```

<details><summary>**Think About It**: Why do organizations often default to reactive troubleshooting?</summary>

Common reasons include:
- **Time pressure**: Production demands make it tempting to apply quick fixes
- **Lack of training**: Technicians may not know RCA methodologies
- **Reward systems**: Organizations may reward "firefighters" who quickly restore production
- **Missing data**: Without good records, patterns are hard to identify
- **Culture**: "We've always done it this way" mentality

The irony is that reactive troubleshooting actually costs more time in the long run due to recurring problems.
</details>

## Systematic Troubleshooting Methodology

Effective troubleshooting follows a structured approach rather than random trial-and-error.

### The DMAIC Troubleshooting Framework

```{r troubleshooting-flow, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
# Create troubleshooting process flow
steps <- data.frame(
  step = 1:6,
  name = c("DEFINE", "MEASURE", "ANALYZE", "IMPLEMENT", "CONTROL", "DOCUMENT"),
  description = c(
    "Clearly state the problem",
    "Gather data and observations",
    "Identify root cause",
    "Apply corrective action",
    "Verify solution works",
    "Record findings"
  ),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
  y = rep(1, 6)
)

ggplot(steps, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x, xend = x + 0.8, y = y, yend = y),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")),
               color = "gray50", size = 1.5,
               data = steps[1:5,]) +
  geom_point(size = 25, color = c("#e74c3c", "#3498db", "#2ecc71",
                                   "#f39c12", "#9b59b6", "#1abc9c")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = step), color = "white", size = 8, fontface = "bold") +
  geom_text(aes(label = name, y = y + 0.25), size = 4, fontface = "bold") +
  geom_text(aes(label = description, y = y - 0.25), size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 6.8)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 1.5)) +
  labs(title = "Systematic Troubleshooting Process") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
```

### Step 1: Define the Problem

A well-defined problem is half-solved. Use the **5W2H** method:

```{r 5w2h-table, echo=FALSE}
w2h <- data.frame(
  Question = c("WHAT", "WHERE", "WHEN", "WHO", "WHY", "HOW", "HOW MUCH"),
  Description = c(
    "What is the problem? What is happening vs. what should happen?",
    "Where does the problem occur? Location, machine, station?",
    "When did it start? When does it occur? Continuous or intermittent?",
    "Who discovered it? Who is affected? Who was operating?",
    "Why is this a problem? What is the impact?",
    "How was the problem detected? How is it manifesting?",
    "How often? How many units affected? What is the magnitude?"
  ),
  Example = c(
    "Motor overheating on conveyor line 3",
    "Discharge end of conveyor, motor housing",
    "Started Monday, occurs after 2 hours of operation",
    "Operator noticed, maintenance called, affects packaging dept",
    "Risk of motor failure, line stoppage, safety hazard",
    "Detected by high-temp alarm at 85°C",
    "Occurs every day, 100% of shifts, 15°C above normal"
  )
)

kable(w2h, col.names = c("Question", "What to Ask", "Example Response"),
      caption = "5W2H Problem Definition Framework") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2c3e50", width = "12%") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "40%") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "48%", background = "#f8f9fa")
```

### Problem Statement Template

> **Good Problem Statement Format:**
> "[WHAT] is occurring at [WHERE] since [WHEN], affecting [WHO/WHAT], with a magnitude of [HOW MUCH]."

**Example:**
> "Motor overheating (85°C vs. normal 70°C) is occurring at Conveyor Line 3 discharge motor since Monday morning, affecting packaging department production, with the condition occurring every shift after approximately 2 hours of operation."

<details><summary>**Practice**: Write a problem statement for this scenario</summary>

**Scenario:** An injection molding machine is producing parts with short shots (incomplete fill). The problem was noticed by the quality inspector during the night shift. About 15% of parts are affected. The issue seems worse when running the larger 500g parts compared to the smaller 200g parts.

**Sample Problem Statement:**
"Short shots (incomplete cavity fill) are occurring on Injection Molding Machine #4 since night shift on Tuesday, affecting 15% of parts produced, with the defect rate increasing significantly when running 500g parts compared to 200g parts."
</details>

### Step 2: Gather Data and Observations

Before making any changes, collect information systematically:

```{r data-gathering, echo=FALSE}
data_sources <- data.frame(
  Source = c("Visual Inspection", "Operator Interview", "Machine Parameters",
             "Historical Records", "Product/Output", "Environmental"),
  What_to_Check = c(
    "Physical condition, wear, contamination, alignment, damage",
    "What changed? When did it start? Any unusual events?",
    "Temperatures, pressures, speeds, currents, positions",
    "Maintenance logs, previous repairs, similar issues",
    "Defect patterns, measurements, reject rates",
    "Temperature, humidity, vibration, power quality"
  ),
  Tools = c(
    "Flashlight, mirror, magnifier, camera",
    "Open-ended questions, active listening",
    "HMI screens, gauges, multimeter, thermal camera",
    "CMMS, logbooks, work orders",
    "Calipers, gauges, CMM, visual inspection",
    "Thermometer, hygrometer, vibration analyzer"
  )
)

kable(data_sources, col.names = c("Data Source", "What to Check", "Tools/Methods"),
      caption = "Systematic Data Gathering Checklist") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "18%")
```

### The "Change Analysis" Approach

Many problems are caused by changes. Ask:

- What changed recently?
- New materials, suppliers, or batches?
- New operators or different shifts?
- Maintenance performed?
- Environmental changes (weather, season)?
- Software updates or parameter changes?
- New products or recipes running?

```{r change-timeline, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=5}
# Create a change timeline visualization
timeline_data <- data.frame(
  event = c("New lubricant\nsupplier", "Operator\ntraining", "PM\ncompleted",
            "Software\nupdate", "Problem\nstarted", "New shift\nschedule"),
  date = as.Date(c("2024-01-15", "2024-01-22", "2024-02-01",
                   "2024-02-05", "2024-02-07", "2024-02-10")),
  y = c(1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1),
  type = c("Change", "Change", "Change", "Change", "Problem", "Change")
)

ggplot(timeline_data, aes(x = date, y = 0)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "gray50", size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = date, yend = y), color = "gray70") +
  geom_point(aes(y = y, color = type), size = 8) +
  geom_text(aes(y = y, label = event), vjust = ifelse(timeline_data$y > 0, -1, 2),
            size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = format(date, "%b %d")), vjust = 2, size = 2.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Change" = "steelblue", "Problem" = "red")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-2, 2)) +
  labs(title = "Change Timeline Analysis",
       subtitle = "Map changes against problem occurrence to identify correlations",
       x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14)
  )
```

## Understanding Root Cause vs. Symptoms

A critical concept in troubleshooting is distinguishing between different levels of causation.

### The Causation Hierarchy

```{r causation-levels, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
# Create causation hierarchy pyramid
levels <- data.frame(
  level = c("Symptom", "Immediate Cause", "Contributing Cause", "Root Cause"),
  y = c(4, 3, 2, 1),
  width = c(3, 4, 5, 6),
  description = c(
    "Observable effect of the problem",
    "Direct cause of the symptom",
    "Factors that enabled the cause",
    "Fundamental reason - fix this to prevent recurrence"
  ),
  example = c(
    "Motor is overheating",
    "Bearing is worn",
    "Lubrication was inadequate",
    "No PM schedule for bearing lubrication"
  ),
  color = c("#e74c3c", "#f39c12", "#3498db", "#27ae60")
)

ggplot(levels, aes(x = 0, y = y)) +
  geom_tile(aes(width = width, height = 0.8, fill = color), color = "white", size = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = level), fontface = "bold", size = 5, color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = description, y = y - 0.25), size = 3, color = "white") +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 4, label = "Example: Motor is overheating",
           hjust = 0, size = 3.5, fontface = "italic") +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 3, label = "Example: Bearing is worn",
           hjust = 0, size = 3.5, fontface = "italic") +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 2, label = "Example: Lubrication inadequate",
           hjust = 0, size = 3.5, fontface = "italic") +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 1, label = "Example: No PM schedule exists",
           hjust = 0, size = 3.5, fontface = "italic") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 7)) +
  labs(title = "Causation Hierarchy",
       subtitle = "Dig deeper to find the root cause - don't stop at symptoms") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Why Finding Root Cause Matters

```{r fix-comparison, echo=FALSE}
fix_levels <- data.frame(
  Level = c("Symptom", "Immediate Cause", "Root Cause"),
  Fix = c("Add cooling fan to motor", "Replace worn bearing",
          "Implement PM schedule with lubrication tasks"),
  Result = c("Motor runs cooler temporarily", "Motor works for a while",
             "Problem eliminated permanently"),
  Recurrence = c("Problem returns in days", "Problem returns in months",
                 "Problem does not recur"),
  Cost_Short = c("$50", "$200", "$500"),
  Cost_Long = c("$5000+ (repeated failures)", "$2400 (annual replacements)",
                "$500 (one-time implementation)")
)

kable(fix_levels, col.names = c("Fix Level", "Action Taken", "Immediate Result",
                                 "Recurrence", "Short-term Cost", "Long-term Cost"),
      caption = "Comparison of Fixes at Different Causation Levels") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(3, background = "#d4edda", bold = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "12%")
```

## The 5 Whys Technique

The **5 Whys** is a simple but powerful technique developed by Sakichi Toyoda and used within Toyota's manufacturing methods.

### How It Works

1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why?" to identify the cause
3. Ask "Why?" again about that cause
4. Continue asking "Why?" until you reach the root cause
5. Typically requires 5 iterations (sometimes more, sometimes less)

### 5 Whys Example: Production Line Stoppage

```{r five-whys-visual, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=8}
whys <- data.frame(
  level = 1:6,
  question = c("Problem:", "Why #1:", "Why #2:", "Why #3:", "Why #4:", "Why #5:"),
  answer = c(
    "Production line stopped",
    "The robot arm stopped moving",
    "The servo motor overloaded and faulted",
    "The gearbox was binding due to wear",
    "The gearbox lubrication had degraded",
    "The lubrication was never changed\n(No PM schedule existed)"
  ),
  y = 6:1
)

ggplot(whys, aes(x = 1, y = y)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = level), width = 5, height = 0.8, color = "white", size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(x = -0.8, label = question), hjust = 1, fontface = "bold", size = 4) +
  geom_text(aes(label = answer), hjust = 0.5, size = 3.5,
            color = ifelse(whys$level == 6, "white", "black")) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.5, xend = 0.5, y = y - 0.4, yend = y - 0.6),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")),
               data = whys[1:5,], color = "gray40") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#3498db", high = "#c0392b", guide = "none") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-2.5, 3.5)) +
  labs(title = "5 Whys Analysis: Production Line Stoppage",
       subtitle = "Each 'Why?' digs deeper toward the root cause") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 11))
```

### 5 Whys Template

```{r five-whys-template, echo=FALSE}
template <- data.frame(
  Step = c("Problem Statement", "Why #1", "Why #2", "Why #3", "Why #4", "Why #5", "Root Cause"),
  Description = c(
    "Clear, specific description of what happened",
    "First-level cause (usually technical/physical)",
    "Why did that first cause occur?",
    "Why did the second cause occur?",
    "Why did the third cause occur?",
    "Why did the fourth cause occur?",
    "The fundamental cause that, if fixed, prevents recurrence"
  ),
  Type = c("Symptom", "Physical", "Physical/Human", "Human/Process",
           "Process/System", "System/Culture", "Root")
)

kable(template, col.names = c("Step", "Description", "Typical Cause Type"),
      caption = "5 Whys Analysis Template") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "18%") %>%
  row_spec(7, background = "#d4edda", bold = TRUE)
```

### Multiple Branches in 5 Whys

Sometimes a problem has multiple causes. When you encounter this, branch your analysis:

```{r branching-whys, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=7}
# Create branching 5 whys diagram
nodes <- data.frame(
  id = 1:9,
  label = c(
    "Defective welds\non assembly",
    "Insufficient\nheat input",
    "Wrong wire\nfeed speed",
    "Operator set\nincorrect parameter",
    "No parameter\nsheet at station",
    "Contaminated\nbase metal",
    "Parts not\ncleaned properly",
    "Cleaning step\nskipped",
    "Rush order\npressure"
  ),
  x = c(0, -2, -3, -3, -3, 2, 2, 2, 2),
  y = c(5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1),
  branch = c("Main", "A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "B")
)

edges <- data.frame(
  from_x = c(0, -2, -3, -3, 0, 2, 2, 2),
  from_y = c(5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, 2),
  to_x = c(-2, -3, -3, -3, 2, 2, 2, 2),
  to_y = c(4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1)
)

ggplot() +
  geom_segment(data = edges, aes(x = from_x, y = from_y, xend = to_x, yend = to_y),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")), color = "gray50") +
  geom_label(data = nodes, aes(x = x, y = y, label = label, fill = branch),
             size = 3, label.padding = unit(0.3, "lines")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Main" = "#e74c3c", "A" = "#3498db", "B" = "#27ae60"),
                    guide = "none") +
  annotate("text", x = -3, y = 0.3, label = "Root Cause A:\nMissing parameter documentation",
           fontface = "bold", size = 3.5, color = "#3498db") +
  annotate("text", x = 2, y = 0.3, label = "Root Cause B:\nSchedule pressure affecting quality",
           fontface = "bold", size = 3.5, color = "#27ae60") +
  labs(title = "Branching 5 Whys Analysis",
       subtitle = "When multiple causes exist, analyze each branch separately") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

<details><summary>**Practice Exercise**: Perform a 5 Whys Analysis</summary>

**Scenario:** A CNC machine produced 50 parts that were all 0.5mm undersize on a critical diameter.

Try to complete the 5 Whys analysis before looking at the sample answer below.

---

**Sample Analysis:**

1. **Problem:** CNC produced 50 undersize parts
2. **Why #1:** The tool offset was set incorrectly
3. **Why #2:** The operator entered the wrong offset value
4. **Why #3:** The operator misread the setup sheet
5. **Why #4:** The setup sheet had poor formatting and small print
6. **Why #5:** No standard format exists for setup documentation

**Root Cause:** Lack of standardized, clear setup documentation

**Corrective Actions:**
- Create standardized setup sheet template with large, clear fonts
- Add visual verification step (photo of correct setup)
- Implement first-piece inspection requirement before production run

## Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram

The **Ishikawa diagram**, also called a **fishbone diagram** or **cause-and-effect diagram**, was developed by Kaoru Ishikawa in the 1960s. It provides a structured way to brainstorm and categorize potential causes.

### The 6M Categories

Manufacturing problems are typically organized using the **6M** categories:

```{r 6m-categories, echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=7}
categories <- data.frame(
  category = c("Man\n(People)", "Machine\n(Equipment)", "Material",
               "Method\n(Process)", "Measurement", "Mother Nature\n(Environment)"),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
  examples = c(
    "Training, skill,\nfatigue, attention",
    "Wear, calibration,\nmaintenance, age",
    "Quality, variation,\nsupplier, contamination",
    "Procedures, sequence,\nparameters, SOP",
    "Accuracy, precision,\ncalibration, method",
    "Temperature, humidity,\nvibration, cleanliness"
  )
)

ggplot(categories, aes(x = x, y = 1)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = category), width = 0.9, height = 1.5, color = "white", size = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = category), y = 1.3, fontface = "bold", size = 4, color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = examples), y = 0.7, size = 2.8, color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#e74c3c", "#3498db", "#27ae60",
                               "#f39c12", "#9b59b6", "#1abc9c"), guide = "none") +
  labs(title = "The 6M Categories for Cause Analysis",
       subtitle = "Standard categories for organizing potential causes in manufacturing") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Constructing a Fishbone Diagram

```{r fishbone-example, echo=FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=9}
# Create a fishbone diagram for "Parts have surface scratches"
# Main spine
spine <- data.frame(
  x = c(-1, 8),
  y = c(0, 0)
)

# Problem box
problem <- data.frame(
  x = 8, y = 0,
  label = "Parts have\nsurface scratches"
)

# Main bones (categories)
bones <- data.frame(
  category = c("Man", "Machine", "Material", "Method", "Measurement", "Environment"),
  x_start = c(1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 5),
  y_start = c(3, 3, 3, -3, -3, -3),
  x_end = c(2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 6),
  y_end = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
)

# Sub-causes for each category

## Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)

**Fault Tree Analysis** is a top-down, deductive analysis method that uses Boolean logic to analyze undesired events. Originally developed for the aerospace industry, FTA is particularly useful for complex systems with multiple potential failure paths.

### FTA Symbols

```{r fta-symbols, echo=FALSE}
symbols <- data.frame(
  Symbol = c("Rectangle", "Circle", "Diamond", "House", "AND Gate", "OR Gate"),
  Name = c("Intermediate Event", "Basic Event", "Undeveloped Event",
           "Normal Event", "AND Gate", "OR Gate"),
  Meaning = c(
    "A fault event that results from combination of other events",
    "A basic failure that cannot be broken down further",
    "Event not analyzed further (outside scope or insufficient data)",
    "An event expected to occur during normal operation",
    "Output occurs only if ALL inputs occur",
    "Output occurs if ANY input occurs"
  ),
  Example = c(
    "Pump fails to deliver flow",
    "Motor winding burnout",
    "Power grid failure",
    "Normal wear over time",
    "Both sensor AND controller fail",
    "Either fuse blows OR breaker trips"
  )
)

kable(symbols, caption = "Fault Tree Analysis Symbols") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%

### Calculating Probability with FTA

FTA allows quantitative risk analysis by calculating the probability of the top event:

**OR Gate:** P(output) = 1 - [(1 - P~A~) × (1 - P~B~) × ...]
*Simplified:* P(output) ≈ P~A~ + P~B~ (when probabilities are small)

**AND Gate:** P(output) = P~A~ × P~B~ × ...

```{r fta-calculation, echo=TRUE}
# Example: Calculate top event probability
# Basic event probabilities (annual failure rates)
P_breaker_trip <- 0.02
P_motor_fail <- 0.01
P_impeller_worn <- 0.03
P_impeller_break <- 0.005
P_shaft_seize <- 0.008
P_tank_empty <- 0.05
P_valve_closed <- 0.01
P_line_blocked <- 0.02

# Impeller failure (OR gate)
P_impeller_fail <- 1 - (1 - P_impeller_worn) * (1 - P_impeller_break)
cat("P(Impeller failure):", round(P_impeller_fail, 4), "\n")

# Mechanical failure (OR gate)
P_mechanical <- 1 - (1 - P_motor_fail) * (1 - P_impeller_fail) * (1 - P_shaft_seize)
cat("P(Mechanical failure):", round(P_mechanical, 4), "\n")

# No fluid available (OR gate)
P_no_fluid <- 1 - (1 - P_tank_empty) * (1 - P_valve_closed) * (1 - P_line_blocked)
cat("P(No fluid available):", round(P_no_fluid, 4), "\n")

# Top event: Pump fails (OR gate)
P_top <- 1 - (1 - P_breaker_trip) * (1 - P_mechanical) * (1 - P_no_fluid)
cat("P(Pump fails to deliver flow):", round(P_top, 4), "\n")
cat("This represents a", round(P_top * 100, 1), "% annual probability of failure")
```

## Pareto Analysis

**Pareto Analysis** is based on the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule): roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. This helps prioritize problem-solving efforts.

### Creating a Pareto Chart

```{r pareto-example, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=7}
# Defect data for a manufacturing line
defects <- data.frame(
  Defect_Type = c("Surface Scratch", "Dimensional Error", "Burrs",
                  "Missing Feature", "Wrong Material", "Contamination",
                  "Color Mismatch", "Packaging Damage"),
  Count = c(145, 98, 67, 34, 28, 21, 15, 12)
)

# Sort by count
defects <- defects[order(-defects$Count),]
defects$Defect_Type <- factor(defects$Defect_Type, levels = defects$Defect_Type)

# Calculate cumulative percentage
defects$Cumulative <- cumsum(defects$Count)
defects$Cum_Percent <- defects$Cumulative / sum(defects$Count) * 100

ggplot(defects, aes(x = Defect_Type)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Count), stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue", width = 0.7) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Cum_Percent * max(Count) / 100, group = 1),
            color = "#e74c3c", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Cum_Percent * max(Count) / 100),
             color = "#e74c3c", size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(y = Count, label = Count), vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5) +
  geom_text(aes(y = Cum_Percent * max(Count) / 100,
                label = paste0(round(Cum_Percent, 0), "%")),
            vjust = -1, hjust = -0.2, size = 3, color = "#e74c3c") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 80 * max(defects$Count) / 100,
             linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
  annotate("text", x = 7.5, y = 80 * max(defects$Count) / 100 + 5,
           label = "80% line", size = 3.5, color = "gray40") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Defect Count",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~. * 100 / max(defects$Count), name = "Cumulative %")
  ) +
  labs(title = "Pareto Chart: Manufacturing Defects by Type",
       subtitle = "Focus on Surface Scratch and Dimensional Error to address 58% of all defects",
       x = "Defect Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
    axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "#e74c3c")
  )
```

### Interpreting Pareto Analysis

```{r pareto-interpretation, echo=TRUE}
# Pareto analysis interpretation
defects <- data.frame(
  Defect = c("Surface Scratch", "Dimensional Error", "Burrs",
             "Missing Feature", "Wrong Material", "Contamination",
             "Color Mismatch", "Packaging Damage"),
  Count = c(145, 98, 67, 34, 28, 21, 15, 12)
)

defects <- defects[order(-defects$Count),]
defects$Cumulative_Pct <- cumsum(defects$Count) / sum(defects$Count) * 100

# Identify the "vital few" (those that contribute to 80%)
vital_few <- defects[defects$Cumulative_Pct <= 80 |
                      c(TRUE, defects$Cumulative_Pct[-nrow(defects)] < 80),]

cat("Total defects:", sum(defects$Count), "\n")
cat("\nVital Few (contributing to ~80% of defects):\n")
print(vital_few[, c("Defect", "Count", "Cumulative_Pct")])
cat("\nFocusing on these", nrow(vital_few), "defect types addresses",
    round(max(vital_few$Cumulative_Pct), 1), "% of all defects")
```

### Stratified Pareto Analysis

Sometimes you need to break down categories further:

```{r stratified-pareto, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# Stratified analysis of "Surface Scratch" defect
scratch_causes <- data.frame(
  Cause = c("Handling damage", "Fixture marks", "Chip scratches",
            "Conveyor marks", "Tool marks", "Unknown"),
  Count = c(52, 38, 28, 15, 8, 4)
)

scratch_causes <- scratch_causes[order(-scratch_causes$Count),]
scratch_causes$Cause <- factor(scratch_causes$Cause, levels = scratch_causes$Cause)
scratch_causes$Cumulative <- cumsum(scratch_causes$Count)
scratch_causes$Cum_Pct <- scratch_causes$Cumulative / sum(scratch_causes$Count) * 100

ggplot(scratch_causes, aes(x = Cause)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Count), stat = "identity", fill = "#27ae60", width = 0.7) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Cum_Pct * max(Count) / 100, group = 1),
            color = "#e74c3c", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Cum_Pct * max(Count) / 100),
             color = "#e74c3c", size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(y = Count, label = Count), vjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 80 * max(scratch_causes$Count) / 100,
             linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Count",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~. * 100 / max(scratch_causes$Count), name = "Cumulative %")
  ) +
  labs(title = "Stratified Pareto: Causes of Surface Scratch Defects",
       subtitle = "Drilling down into the #1 defect type",
       x = "Scratch Cause") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14)
  )
```

## Is/Is Not Analysis

**Is/Is Not Analysis** is a structured comparison technique that helps narrow down the scope and identify distinguishing factors of a problem.

### Is/Is Not Matrix

```{r is-isnot-example, echo=FALSE}
is_isnot <- data.frame(
  Dimension = c("WHAT", "WHAT", "WHERE", "WHERE", "WHEN", "WHEN", "EXTENT", "EXTENT"),
  Question = c(
    "What object has the problem?",
    "What is the defect/symptom?",
    "Where is the problem observed?",
    "Where on the object is the defect?",
    "When was it first observed?",
    "When in the process/cycle?",
    "How many units affected?",
    "Is it trending up/down/stable?"
  ),
  IS = c(
    "Motor on Line 3",
    "Overheating (85°C)",
    "Packaging area, Station 4",
    "Motor housing, bearing end",
    "Monday morning shift",
    "After 2 hours of operation",
    "100% - every shift",
    "Stable - same every day"
  ),
  IS_NOT = c(
    "Motors on Lines 1, 2, 4",
    "Noise, vibration, or failure",
    "Any other station",
    "Drive end, junction box",
    "Before weekend (Friday OK)",
    "Cold start or end of shift",
    "Intermittent",
    "Getting worse over time"
  ),
  Distinction = c(
    "Line 3 motor is older, different model",
    "Thermal issue, not mechanical yet",
    "Station 4 has higher load demand",
    "Bearing end runs hotter normally",
    "Something changed over weekend",
    "Heat buildup issue",
    "Consistent problem",
    "Stable - not progressive failure"
  )
)

kable(is_isnot, col.names = c("Dimension", "Question", "IS", "IS NOT", "What's Different?"),
      caption = "Is/Is Not Analysis: Motor Overheating Problem") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "8%") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "20%") %>%
  column_spec(3, background = "#d4edda", width = "22%") %>%
  column_spec(4, background = "#f8d7da", width = "22%") %>%
  column_spec(5, background = "#fff3cd", width = "28%")
```

### Key Insights from Is/Is Not Analysis

From the example above, we can identify:

1. **Line 3 specific** - Not a general problem across all lines
2. **Thermal, not mechanical** - Overheating but no noise/vibration yet
3. **After warm-up** - Heat accumulation issue
4. **Started after weekend** - Something changed

**Investigation focus:** What changed over the weekend? Check maintenance logs, any work done on Line 3, any environmental changes.

### D3: Containment Actions

Containment is crucial to protect the customer while you investigate:

```{r containment-types, echo=FALSE}
containment <- data.frame(
  Type = c("Sort & Inspect", "Rework/Repair", "Scrap", "Hold/Quarantine",
           "Increase Monitoring", "Supplier Notification", "Customer Alert"),

    "100% inspection of suspect inventory to separate good from bad",
    "Repair nonconforming units if possible and economical",
    "Dispose of units that cannot be repaired",
    "Prevent movement of suspect material until disposition",
    "Add inspections, increase sampling, tighten control limits",
    "Notify suppliers if incoming material is suspected",
    "Alert customers to check their inventory if product shipped"
  ),
  Example = c(
    "Inspect all parts from Lot 2024-0215",

    "Dispose of parts with cracks",
    "Tag and segregate all parts from affected shift",
    "Add 100% visual inspection at Pack station",
    "Request material certification from steel supplier",
    "Contact distributor about potentially affected batch"

## Summary

Effective troubleshooting and root cause analysis require:

1. **Systematic approach** - Don't guess; follow a structured methodology
2. **Clear problem definition** - Use 5W2H to clearly define what you're solving
3. **Data-driven analysis** - Collect facts before jumping to conclusions
4. **Root cause focus** - Don't stop at symptoms; dig to fundamental causes
5. **Multiple tools** - Use 5 Whys, Fishbone, FTA, Pareto as appropriate
6. **Effective corrective actions** - Aim for elimination, not just mitigation
7. **Verification** - Confirm your fix actually works with data
8. **Documentation** - Capture learnings to prevent recurrence

Remember: The goal isn't just to fix today's problem - it's to prevent tomorrow's.

## Review Questions

<details><summary>**Question 1**: What is the difference between a symptom, immediate cause, and root cause? Provide an example of each for a machine that is producing parts with excessive surface roughness.</summary>

**Answer:**

- **Symptom**: The observable effect of the problem
  - *Example: Parts have Ra surface roughness of 3.2 μm when specification is 1.6 μm*

- **Immediate cause**: The direct, technical cause of the symptom
  - *Example: Cutting tool is worn beyond its effective life*

- **Root cause**: The fundamental reason that, if eliminated, prevents recurrence
  - *Example: No tool life monitoring system exists; operators judge tool changes by intuition rather than data*

Fixing the root cause (implementing tool life tracking) prevents the problem from recurring, whereas just replacing the tool (addressing immediate cause) means it will happen again.
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 2**: A food processing plant is experiencing frequent jams on their packaging line. Perform a 5 Whys analysis given the following information: The jam occurs at the carton loading station, started last week, happens 4-5 times per shift, and the maintenance team found the timing of the pusher mechanism is off.</summary>

**Answer:**

1. **Problem**: Carton loading station jams 4-5 times per shift
2. **Why #1**: Cartons are not in position when pusher activates → Timing mismatch
3. **Why #2**: Pusher timing is off by approximately 0.3 seconds
4. **Why #3**: Timing adjustment was changed during last week's maintenance
5. **Why #4**: Technician didn't have correct specification for timing setting
6. **Why #5**: Maintenance procedure doesn't include timing specifications

**Root Cause**: Maintenance procedures lack critical parameter specifications

**Corrective Actions**:
- Update maintenance procedure with correct timing specification (180ms ± 10ms)
- Restore timing to correct setting immediately
- Review other procedures for missing specifications
- Add parameter verification checklist to PM activities
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 3**: Create a fishbone diagram outline (list the potential causes under each 6M category) for the problem "CNC machine producing parts 0.05mm oversize."</summary>

**Answer:**

**MAN (People)**
- Operator entered wrong offset
- Incorrect setup procedure followed
- Inadequate training on new program
- Fatigue/distraction during setup

**MACHINE (Equipment)**
- Spindle thermal growth
- Ballscrew wear/backlash
- Tool holder runout
- Axis positioning error

**MATERIAL**
- Material hardness variation
- Different lot from supplier
- Material springback
- Incorrect material grade

**METHOD (Process)**
- Wrong tool offset entered
- Program error in G-code
- Incorrect cutting parameters
- Missing roughing pass

**MEASUREMENT**
- Gauge out of calibration
- Wrong measurement technique
- Temperature affecting measurement
- Incorrect datum reference

**MOTHER NATURE (Environment)**
- Shop temperature variation
- Coolant temperature change
- Vibration from nearby equipment
- Humidity affecting gauges
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 4**: Given the following defect data from a sheet metal stamping operation, create a Pareto analysis and identify the vital few defects to focus on.</summary>

| Defect Type | Count |
|------------|-------|
| Scratches | 89 |
| Burrs | 156 |
| Wrinkles | 45 |
| Splits/Cracks | 28 |
| Dimensional | 112 |
| Surface Dents | 67 |
| Missing Features | 18 |

**Answer:**

```{r pareto-practice, echo=TRUE}
# Create and analyze the data
defects <- data.frame(
  Type = c("Burrs", "Dimensional", "Scratches", "Surface Dents",
           "Wrinkles", "Splits/Cracks", "Missing Features"),
  Count = c(156, 112, 89, 67, 45, 28, 18)
)

# Sort by count descending
defects <- defects[order(-defects$Count),]

# Calculate percentages
defects$Percent <- defects$Count / sum(defects$Count) * 100
defects$Cumulative <- cumsum(defects$Percent)

# Display results
print(defects)

# Identify vital few
vital_few <- defects$Type[defects$Cumulative <= 80 |
                           c(TRUE, defects$Cumulative[-nrow(defects)] < 80)]
cat("\nVital Few (contributing to ~80%):", paste(vital_few, collapse = ", "))
```

The **vital few** are Burrs, Dimensional errors, and Scratches - addressing these three defect types would address approximately 69% of all defects. Adding Surface Dents would bring the total to 82%.
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 5**: What are the key differences between verification and validation in the context of corrective actions?</summary>

**Answer:**

| Aspect | Verification | Validation |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Question asked | Did we implement the action correctly? | Did the action solve the problem? |
| Focus | Process compliance | Results/outcomes |
| Timing | During/immediately after implementation | Ongoing monitoring after implementation |
| Methods | Audits, checklists, inspections | Data analysis, trend charts, SPC |
| Example | Confirm new sensor was installed per specification | Measure defect rate over 30 days to confirm reduction |

**Verification** confirms the action was done right.
**Validation** confirms we did the right action.

Both are required - an action can be implemented perfectly (verified) but still not solve the problem (not validated).
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 6**: An aerospace manufacturer has a requirement to use the 8D methodology for customer complaints. What happens in D3 (Containment) and why is it critical?</summary>

**Answer:**

**D3 Containment Actions** protect the customer while the root cause investigation continues. Key activities include:

1. **Immediate actions**:
   - Quarantine suspect inventory (tagged, segregated)
   - 100% inspection of suspect lots
   - Increase monitoring at subsequent operations
   - Sort parts at customer location if already shipped

2. **Documentation**:
   - Identify affected lot numbers, date codes, serial numbers
   - Quantify the scope of potential exposure
   - Document all containment actions taken

3. **Communication**:
   - Notify customer of actions being taken
   - Alert downstream operations
   - Inform suppliers if incoming material involved

**Why critical**:
- Prevents additional defective product from reaching the customer
- Limits the scope of the problem (cost, liability)
- Demonstrates responsiveness to customer
- Buys time for proper root cause investigation
- In aerospace, safety-of-flight concerns make containment essential

Without effective containment, the problem continues while you investigate, increasing customer impact and costs exponentially.
</details>

<details><summary>**Question 7**: Why might a team's 5 Whys analysis stop too early? What are signs that you haven't reached the true root cause?</summary>

**Answer:**

**Reasons teams stop too early**:
1. **Blame arrives** - Analysis ends at "operator error" without asking why the error occurred
2. **Comfort zone** - Team stops when they reach a cause they can easily fix
3. **Time pressure** - Rush to implement a fix, skipping deeper analysis
4. **Technical limit** - Team lacks expertise to go deeper into certain areas
5. **Defensiveness** - Reaching causes that implicate management or systems creates resistance

**Signs you haven't reached root cause**:
1. **Recurrence** - If the fix is "more training" or "be more careful," problem will return
2. **Human-based answer** - Root causes should typically be systems/processes, not individuals
3. **No prevention mechanism** - If fixing this cause doesn't prevent future occurrences, keep asking why
4. **Can still ask "why?"** - If there's a logical next level to investigate
5. **Administrative fix only** - If the solution is just a procedure or checklist with no engineering controls

**Example of stopping too early**:
- Stopping at: "Operator set wrong parameter"
- Should continue: Why? → No parameter sheet at workstation → Why? → No standard work documentation exists → Root cause: Missing standardized work process

The true root cause typically relates to systems, processes, or management decisions rather than individual actions.

<details><summary>**Question 8**: Describe how you would use Pareto analysis in a stratified manner to drill down into a quality problem.</summary>

**Answer:**

**Stratified Pareto Analysis** involves creating multiple levels of Pareto charts, progressively drilling down into the vital few categories.

**Example: High scrap rate at a machining shop**

**Level 1: Scrap by defect type**
1. Create Pareto of all defect types
2. Result: "Dimensional errors" is 45% of all scrap - investigate this first

**Level 2: Dimensional errors by machine**
1. Create Pareto of dimensional errors broken down by machine
2. Result: Machine #4 accounts for 60% of dimensional errors

**Level 3: Machine #4 dimensional errors by feature**
1. Create Pareto of which dimensions are failing on Machine #4
2. Result: Bore diameter is 70% of Machine #4 dimensional issues

**Level 4: Bore diameter issues by shift/operator**
1. Create Pareto by shift
2. Result: Evenly distributed - not operator-dependent (machine issue confirmed)

**Final Analysis**: Investigate boring operation on Machine #4 specifically - likely tool wear, spindle issue, or program error.

The stratified approach efficiently narrows focus from "we have a scrap problem" to "boring operation on Machine #4 has a systematic error."

<details><summary>**Question 9**: A defense contractor needs to analyze a safety-critical failure. Why might Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) be preferred over simpler methods like 5 Whys?</summary>

**Answer:**

**FTA advantages for safety-critical analysis**:

1. **Handles complexity**:
   - Safety-critical systems often have multiple redundancies and complex failure paths
   - FTA can model combinations of events that must occur together (AND gates) or alternatively (OR gates)
   - 5 Whys follows single linear path; FTA captures parallel paths

2. **Quantitative capability**:
   - FTA allows probability calculations for top event
   - Can identify minimum cut sets (smallest combinations that cause failure)
   - Supports reliability and safety integrity level (SIL) calculations
   - Defense/aerospace require quantitative risk assessment

3. **Documentation requirements**:
   - Regulatory bodies (FAA, DoD) often require FTA for critical systems
   - Provides auditable, traceable analysis
   - Standard symbols and methodology

4. **Identifies hidden failures**:
   - Can reveal single points of failure
   - Shows where redundancy is (or isn't) effective
   - Identifies common cause failures that defeat redundancy

5. **Design improvement**:
   - Visual representation helps identify where to add safeguards
   - Sensitivity analysis shows which basic events most affect risk
   - Supports design reviews and safety cases

**Example**: A missile guidance system failure
- 5 Whys might identify one cause path
- FTA would show all possible failure paths, calculate overall failure probability, and identify that two specific sensor failures AND a software error all occurring together could cause the top event, even though each alone is unlikely.
