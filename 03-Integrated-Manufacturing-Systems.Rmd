# Integrated Manufacturing Systems

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Material Handling Methods & Systems

There are four common types of production facility layouts, detailing the key **features** that make each layout suitable for specific production needs and the **typical methods and equipment** used within that structure.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the necessary packages
# dplyr is used for the tibble() function and the pipe operator (%>%)
library(dplyr) 
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra) # Essential for advanced styling

# 1. Create a tibble (data frame) with your table content
data <- tibble(
  `Layout Type` = c("Fixed-Position", "Process", "Cellular", "Product"),
  Features = c("Product is large and heavy, low production rates", 
               "Medium and hard product variety, low and medium production rates", 
               "Soft product variety, medium production rates", 
               "No product variety or soft product variety, high production rates"),
  `Typical Methods and Equipment` = c("Cranes, hoists, fork lift trucks", 
                                      "Fork lift trucks, automated guided vehicles, manual loading at workstations", 
                                      "Conveyors, manual handling for loading and moving between stations", 
                                      "Conveyors for product flow, fork lift trucks or automated guided vehicles to deliver parts to stations")
)

# 2. Use kable() and kableExtra to create and style the HTML table
data %>%
  # Start with kable: it converts the data into a table structure.
  # We specify format = "html" for best use of kableExtra features.
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Material Handling Methods by Plant Layout") %>%
  
  # kable_styling: Applies general table settings.
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), 
    # "striped": alternating row colors
    # "hover": row highlights when mouse hovers over it
    # "condensed": makes the table more compact
    full_width = FALSE, # Prevents the table from stretching to 100% of the page width
    position = "center" # Centers the table on the page
  ) %>%
  
  # column_spec: Styles specific columns.
  column_spec(
    column = 1,  # Target the first column ("Layout Type")
    bold = TRUE, # Make the text bold
    width = "10em" # Set a fixed width to prevent wrapping issues
  ) %>%
  
  # row_spec: Styles specific rows.
  # This highlights the "Fixed-Position" row (row 1) in a light grey.
  row_spec(
    row = 1,
    background = "#f2f2f2" 
  )
```

## Fundamentals of a production Line

A **production line** consists of a series of workstations arranged so that the product moves from one station to the next, and at each location a portion of the total work is performed on it.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Production Line"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ProductionLine.jpg")
```

### Methods of Work Transport

### Manual Methods of Work Transport {-}
Manual methods involve passing the work units between stations by hand.

##### Types: {-}
  - Work units moved in batches
  - Work units moved one at a time
  
##### Problems: {-}
  - Starving of stations
  - Blocking of stations
  - No pacing

### Mechanized Methods of Work Transport {-}
Mechanized methods use powered conveyor or other mechanized apparatus to move work units.
Three major types of work transfer systems are used on production lines:
  
  - continuous transfer
  - synchronous transfer
  - asynchronous transfer

##### Categories: {-}
  - Work units attached to conveyor
  - Work units are removable from conveyor

##### Problems {-}
  - Starving of stations
  - Incomplete units

### Continuous Transport {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Continuous Transport"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ContinuousTransport.png")
```
Conveyor moves at constant velocity v~c~

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Synchronous Transport"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SynchronousTransport.png")
```
All work units are moved simultaneously to their respective next workstations with quick, discontinuous motion.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Asynchronous Transport"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/AsynchronousTransport.png")
```
Work units move independently, not simultaneously. A work unit departs a given station when the worker releases it. Small queues of parts can form at each station.


### What is Work Cycle?
##### Manually Operated Machine {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Manually Operated Machine"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ManuallyOperatedMachine.png")
```
Manually operated machines are controlled or supervised by a human worker. The machine provides the power for the operation and the worker provides the control. The entire work cycle is operator controlled.

##### Semi-Automated Machine {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Semi-Automated Machine"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SemiautomatedMachine.png")
```

A semi-automated machine performs a portion of the work cycle under some form of program control, and a worker tends to the machine for the remainder of the cycle. Typical worker tasks include loading and unloading parts.

##### Fully-Automated Machine {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Fully-Automated Machine"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fullyautomatedMachine.png")
```

Machine operates for extended periods (longer than one work cycle) without worker attention.

### Work Transport Between Stations

Two general categories of work transport in multi-station manufacturing systems:

1. Fixed routing
  - Work units always flow through the same sequence of workstations
  - Most production lines exemplify this category
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Fixed Routing"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fixedrouting.png")
```
2. Variable routing
  - Work units are moved through a variety of different station sequences
  - Most job shops exemblify this category
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Variable Routing"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/variablerouting.png")
```


### ⏰ Explaining Manufacturing Process Times

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Timing Definition"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/TimingDefinition.jpg")
```
The flowchart illustrates three crucial time metrics: **Lead Time**, **Throughput Time**, and **Cycle Time**. These metrics are sequential, with the largest time window encompassing the smaller ones.

#### Lead Time

* **Definition:** **Lead Time** is the total time elapsed from the moment a customer **places an order** until they **receive the finished product**. It represents the customer's total wait time.
* **What it includes:** It covers every step, from order receipt through manufacturing, testing, and shipping (Delivery at Customer).
* **Example:** A customer orders a custom-made widget on Monday. If order processing, manufacturing, and shipping take a total of 6 days, the **Total Lead Time = 6 days.**


#### Throughput Time

* **Definition:** **Throughput Time** (or Manufacturing Lead Time) is the time required to convert raw materials into a finished product that is ready for dispatch. It starts when the **Raw Material (RM) is Received** and ends when the product is **Dispatched** from the factory.
* **What it includes:** All activities within the factory walls, including processing (Turning, Drilling, Tapping), movement, inspection, and any queuing/waiting time before dispatch.
* **Example:** If the total time spent from raw material receipt to final dispatch from the factory is 3 days, the **Total Throughput Time = 3 days.**

#### Cycle Time

Cycle Time is typically broken into two related concepts: **Overall Cycle Time** and **Individual Cycle Time**.

##### Overall Cycle Time (As labeled in the diagram)

* **Definition:** The **Overall Cycle Time** refers to the total time spent actively converting the raw material into a final, ready-to-ship product, beginning with the first value-added operation (like Turning) and ending with the last (like Dispatch).
* **What it includes:** The sum of all individual process times plus any immediate in-process wait times (e.g., Cycle Time 1 + Cycle Time 2 + ...).

##### Individual Cycle Time (`Cycle Time 1`, `Cycle Time 2`, etc.)

* **Definition:** This refers to the **time it takes to complete a single specific task** or process step (e.g., Turning, Drilling, Tapping) on a single product unit.
* **Example:** If the individual processing steps take 30 minutes for Turning, 15 minutes for Drilling, and 10 minutes for Tapping, these are the individual cycle times for those specific tasks.

### 🚀 Cycle Time vs. Efficiency in Manufacturing [@Arcera]

Ever wondered how to measure and improve your manufacturing process? Let’s dive into two key metrics that drive efficiency: **Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT)** and **Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE)**!


#### 🔍 Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT)

This metric tells us how long it takes to produce each unit.

##### Formula:
$$
MCT = \frac{\text{Production Time}}{\text{Units Produced}}
$$

Understanding MCT allows us to identify delays and improve production speed. Reducing cycle time leads to quicker delivery and increased customer satisfaction!

##### Calculation Example:

Let's assume a production run takes 480 minutes (8 hours) and produces 60 units.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Define the variables
production_time_minutes <- 480 # Total time the process ran
units_produced <- 60

# Calculate Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT)
MCT <- production_time_minutes / units_produced

# Print the result
cat("Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT):", MCT, "minutes per unit")
```

#### 📈 Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE)

This metric reveals the efficiency of the production process by focusing on the actual "Process Time" (value-added time) within the entire production period.

##### Formula:
$$
\text{MCE} = \left(\frac{\text{Process Time}}{\text{Production Time}}\right) \times 100\%
$$

**Process Time** is the time spent on activities that directly add value to the product. **Production Time** includes process time plus non-value-added time (e.g., inspection, waiting, moving).

Higher MCE means less waste and more value-added time in production. Aiming for a higher MCE drives leaner operations and cost savings.

##### Calculation Example:


```{r echo=FALSE}
# --- Define the range for Production Time (Total Time) ---
# Let's assume the total production time is between 400 and 600 minutes
min_production <- 400
max_production <- 600

# Generate a random total production time
production_time_minutes <- runif(1, min = min_production, max = max_production)

# --- Define the range for Process Time (Value-Added Work) ---
# The process time must be less than or equal to the production time.
# Let's assume the value-added work is between 50 and the generated production time.
min_process <- 50
max_process <- production_time_minutes # Upper limit is the randomly generated production time

# Generate a random process time
process_time_minutes <- runif(1, min = min_process, max = max_process)

# --- Calculate Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE) ---
MCE <- (process_time_minutes / production_time_minutes) * 100

# --- Print the results ---
cat("Total Production Time (minutes):", round(production_time_minutes, 2), "\n")
cat("Value-Added Process Time (minutes):", round(process_time_minutes, 2), "\n")
cat("--- \n")
cat("Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE):", round(MCE, 2), "%")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="MCT and MCE"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1731060093907.jpg")
```

### Product Variations
In modern manufacturing, systems must handle different levels of product variety. We distinguish between **Hard Product Variety** (significant differences between products) and **Soft Product Variety** (small differences, such as color or minor features). As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:prod-variety-plot2), the complexity of the system increases as we move toward mass customization.

## Manual Assembly Lines
Manual assembly lines consist of multiple workstations where human workers perform repetitive tasks. The efficiency of these lines is governed by the relationship between production rate and cycle time.

### Production Rate and Cycle Time
The production rate ($R_p$) is the number of units produced per hour. The cycle time ($T_c$) is the time interval between units coming off the end of the line.

The mathematical relationship is defined as:
$$T_c = \frac{60}{R_p}$$
where $T_c$ is in minutes and $R_p$ is in units/hour.

### Line Balancing and Repositioning Losses
One of the greatest challenges in manual lines is **Line Balancing**. This involves assigning tasks to workstations so that the total work content time ($T_{wc}$) is distributed evenly. The efficiency of the balance ($E_b$) is calculated as:

$$E_b = \frac{T_{wc}}{n T_c}$$

where $n$ is the number of workstations.

```{r prod-variety-plot2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Relationship between Production Volume and Product Variety.", label= prod-variety-plot2}
library(ggplot2)

# Simulating data for manufacturing system types
df <- data.frame(
  Variety = c("Low", "Medium", "High"),
  Volume = c(1000, 500, 50),
  Type = c("Transfer Line", "FMS", "Job Shop")
)

ggplot(df, aes(x = Variety, y = Volume, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Volume vs. Variety Trade-off",
       x = "Product Variety",
       y = "Annual Production Volume") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```
## Automated Production Lines {#automated-lines}

Automated lines reduce human intervention by using mechanized transfer systems and automated workstations. These systems are typically used for high-volume production where the work content is well-defined.

### Types of Automated Lines
There are two primary configurations for these systems:

* **In-line configuration:** A straight line of workstations where the part moves sequentially from one station to the next.
* **Rotary configuration:** Workstations are arranged around a circular table, often called an indexing table.



### Analysis of Automated Production Lines
The performance of an automated line is often degraded by station failures. If $p$ is the probability of a station failure and $T$ is the average downtime, the actual production rate ($R_p$) is significantly lower than the ideal rate ($R_c$) due to downtime. The actual cycle time ($T_p$) is calculated as:

$$T_p = T_c + pT$$

Where:
* $T_p$ = Average production time per unit.
* $T_c$ = Ideal cycle time.
* $p$ = Probability of station failure.
* $T$ = Average downtime to repair and restart.

### Analysis of Automated Production Lines
The performance of an automated line is rarely ideal; it is degraded by station failures (e.g., tool breakage, jams).

If we define:
* $T_c$: Ideal cycle time (minutes/cycle).
* $p$: Probability of a station failure per cycle.
* $T$: Average downtime per failure (minutes) to repair and restart.

The **Actual Cycle Time ($T_p$)** increases significantly:
$$T_p = T_c + p \times T$$

Consequently, the **Actual Production Rate ($R_p$)** (units per hour) drops below the ideal rate ($R_c = 60/T_c$):
$$R_p = \frac{60}{T_p} = \frac{60}{T_c + pT}$$

To visualize the severe impact of even small failure probabilities on high-speed lines, we can simulate different downtime scenarios. Figure \@ref(fig:downtime-sim) illustrates how quickly production capacity is lost as reliability decreases.

```{r downtime-sim, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Simulation: Impact of Failure Probability (p) and Average Downtime (T) on Hourly Production Rate."}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)

#--- Simulation Parameters ---
Ideal_Tc <- 1.0  # Ideal cycle time is 1 minute per part
Ideal_Rp <- 60 / Ideal_Tc # Ideal rate is 60 units/hour

# 1. Create a range of failure probabilities (p) from 0% to 20%
p_range <- seq(0, 0.20, by = 0.005)

# 2. Define different repair time scenarios (T)
downtime_scenarios <- data.frame(
  Scenario = c("Quick Fix (T=5 min)", "Major Repair (T=30 min)"),
  T_val = c(5, 30)
)

# 3. Generate simulation data grid
sim_data <- expand.grid(p = p_range, Scenario = downtime_scenarios$Scenario) %>%
  left_join(downtime_scenarios, by = "Scenario") %>%
  mutate(
    # Calculate Actual Cycle Time: Tp = Tc + p*T
    Tp = Ideal_Tc + (p * T_val),
    # Calculate Actual Production Rate: Rp = 60 / Tp
    Rp = 60 / Tp
  )

#--- Visualization ---
ggplot(sim_data, aes(x = p, y = Rp, color = Scenario)) +
  # Add the simulation lines
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  # Add a reference line for the Ideal Rate
  geom_hline(yintercept = Ideal_Rp, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey50") +
  annotate("text", x = 0.01, y = Ideal_Rp + 2, label = "Ideal Rate (Zero Failures)", color = "grey50", hjust = 0) +
  # Styling and Labels
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(title = "Production Rate Degradation Analysis",
       subtitle = paste0("Base Ideal Cycle Time (Tc) = ", Ideal_Tc, " min/unit"),
       x = "Probability of Station Failure per Cycle (p)",
       y = "Actual Production Rate (Rp) [units/hour]",
       color = "Downtime Scenario (T)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

As demonstrated in Figure @ref(fig:downtime-sim), even a seemingly low failure probability of 5% ($p=0.05$) can cripple production if the average repair time is long. In the "Major Repair" scenario at 5% failure, production drops from an ideal 60 units/hr to roughly 24 units/hr—a 60% loss in capacity. This highlights why preventive maintenance and rapid repair protocols are critical in automated systems.

## Cellular Manufacturing {#cellular-manufacturing}

Cellular manufacturing applies **Group Technology (GT)** to organize production into cells that specialize in "families" of parts.

### Part Families
A part family is a collection of parts that share similar geometric shapes or manufacturing process steps. By grouping these together, we significantly reduce setup times and simplify tooling requirements.

### Machine Cells
Machine cells are designed to process one or more part families. The arrangement usually follows a **U-shape**, which allows a single operator to move between multiple machines efficiently, facilitating better communication and line balancing.



## Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) and Cells {#fms-section}

An FMS is a highly automated GT cell, consisting of a group of processing stations (usually CNC machines) interconnected by an automated handling system.

### Integrating the FMS Components
Integration is achieved through a central computer system that coordinates:

1.  **Workstation operations:** Sending CNC programs to individual machines.
2.  **Material handling system:** Controlling AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) or conveyors.
3.  **Loading and unloading:** Managing the entry and exit of parts from the system.

### Applications of Flexible Manufacturing Systems
FMS is best suited for mid-volume, mid-variety production where the cost of a fully dedicated transfer line is too high, but the manual job shop is too slow and inefficient.

### Mass Customization
Mass customization is the logic of providing products tailored to individual customer needs at a cost near that of mass-produced items [@groover2016]. As seen in Figure \@ref(fig:prod-variety-plot2), FMS is the primary technological enabler of this strategy.

## Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) {#cim-section}

CIM represents the total integration of all aspects of the manufacturing enterprise through computers. It creates a seamless flow of information from the design phase to the shipping dock.



CIM includes not just the shop floor hardware (FMS, Robots), but also:

* **CAD/CAM:** Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing.
* **ERP:** Enterprise Resource Planning for resource management.
* **CAPP:** Computer-Aided Process Planning.
