# Integrated Manufacturing Systems

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Material Handling Methods & Systems

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the necessary packages
# dplyr is used for the tibble() function and the pipe operator (%>%)
library(dplyr) 
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra) # Essential for advanced styling

# 1. Create a tibble (data frame) with your table content
data <- tibble(
  `Layout Type` = c("Fixed-Position", "Process", "Cellular", "Product"),
  Features = c("Product is large and heavy, low production rates", 
               "Medium and hard product variety, low and medium production rates", 
               "Soft product variety, medium production rates", 
               "No product variety or soft product variety, high production rates"),
  `Typical Methods and Equipment` = c("Cranes, hoists, fork lift trucks", 
                                      "Fork lift trucks, automated guided vehicles, manual loading at workstations", 
                                      "Conveyors, manual handling for loading and moving between stations", 
                                      "Conveyors for product flow, fork lift trucks or automated guided vehicles to deliver parts to stations")
)

# 2. Use kable() and kableExtra to create and style the HTML table
data %>%
  # Start with kable: it converts the data into a table structure.
  # We specify format = "html" for best use of kableExtra features.
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Material Handling Methods by Plant Layout") %>%
  
  # kable_styling: Applies general table settings.
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), 
    # "striped": alternating row colors
    # "hover": row highlights when mouse hovers over it
    # "condensed": makes the table more compact
    full_width = FALSE, # Prevents the table from stretching to 100% of the page width
    position = "center" # Centers the table on the page
  ) %>%
  
  # column_spec: Styles specific columns.
  column_spec(
    column = 1,  # Target the first column ("Layout Type")
    bold = TRUE, # Make the text bold
    width = "10em" # Set a fixed width to prevent wrapping issues
  ) %>%
  
  # row_spec: Styles specific rows.
  # This highlights the "Fixed-Position" row (row 1) in a light grey.
  row_spec(
    row = 1,
    background = "#f2f2f2" 
  )
```

## Fundamentals of a production Line

A **production line** consists of a series of workstations arranged so that the product moves from one station to the next, and at each location a portion of the total work is performed on it.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Production Line"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ProductionLine.jpg")
```

### Methods of Work Transport

### Manual Methods of Work Transport {-}
Manual methods involve passing the work units between stations by hand.

##### Types: {-}
  - Work units moved in batches
  - Work units moved one at a time
  
##### Problems: {-}
  - Starving of stations
  - Blocking of stations
  - No pacing

### Mechanized Methods of Work Transport {-}
Mechanized methods use powered conveyor or other mechanized apparatus to move work units.
Three major types of work transfer systems are used on production lines:
  
  - continuous transfer
  - synchronous transfer
  - asynchronous transfer

##### Categories: {-}
  - Work units attached to conveyor
  - Work units are removable from conveyor

##### Problems {-}
  - Starving of stations
  - Incomplete units

### Continuous Transport {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Continuous Transport"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ContinuousTransport.png")
```
Conveyor moves at constant velocity v~c~

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Synchronous Transport"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SynchronousTransport.png")
```
All work units are moved simultaneously to their respective next workstations with quick, discontinuous motion.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Asynchronous Transport"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/AsynchronousTransport.png")
```
Work units move independently, not simultaneously. A work unit departs a given station when the worker releases it. Small queues of parts can form at each station.


### What is Work Cycle?
##### Manually Operated Machine {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Manually Operated Machine"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ManuallyOperatedMachine.png")
```
Manually operated machines are controlled or supervised by a human worker. The machine provides the power for the operation and the worker provides the control. The entire work cycle is operator controlled.

##### Semi-Automated Machine {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Semi-Automated Machine"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SemiautomatedMachine.png")
```

A semi-automated machine performs a portion of the work cycle under some form of program control, and a worker tends to the machine for the remainder of the cycle. Typical worker tasks include loading and unloading parts.

##### Fully-Automated Machine {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Fully-Automated Machine"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fullyautomatedMachine.png")
```

Machine operates for extended periods (longer than one work cycle) without worker attention.

### Work Transport Between Stations

Two general categories of work transport in multi-station manufacturing systems:

1. Fixed routing
  - Work units always flow through the same sequence of workstations
  - Most production lines exemplify this category
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Fixed Routing"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fixedrouting.png")
```
2. Variable routing
  - Work units are moved through a variety of different station sequences
  - Most job shops exemblify this category
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Variable Routing"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/variablerouting.png")
```


### ⏰ Explaining Manufacturing Process Times

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Timing Definition"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/TimingDefinition.jpg")
```
The flowchart illustrates three crucial time metrics: **Lead Time**, **Throughput Time**, and **Cycle Time**. These metrics are sequential, with the largest time window encompassing the smaller ones.

#### Lead Time

* **Definition:** **Lead Time** is the total time elapsed from the moment a customer **places an order** until they **receive the finished product**. It represents the customer's total wait time.
* **What it includes:** It covers every step, from order receipt through manufacturing, testing, and shipping (Delivery at Customer).
* **Example:** A customer orders a custom-made widget on Monday. If order processing, manufacturing, and shipping take a total of 6 days, the **Total Lead Time = 6 days.**


#### Throughput Time

* **Definition:** **Throughput Time** (or Manufacturing Lead Time) is the time required to convert raw materials into a finished product that is ready for dispatch. It starts when the **Raw Material (RM) is Received** and ends when the product is **Dispatched** from the factory.
* **What it includes:** All activities within the factory walls, including processing (Turning, Drilling, Tapping), movement, inspection, and any queuing/waiting time before dispatch.
* **Example:** If the total time spent from raw material receipt to final dispatch from the factory is 3 days, the **Total Throughput Time = 3 days.**

#### Cycle Time

Cycle Time is typically broken into two related concepts: **Overall Cycle Time** and **Individual Cycle Time**.

##### Overall Cycle Time (As labeled in the diagram)

* **Definition:** The **Overall Cycle Time** refers to the total time spent actively converting the raw material into a final, ready-to-ship product, beginning with the first value-added operation (like Turning) and ending with the last (like Dispatch).
* **What it includes:** The sum of all individual process times plus any immediate in-process wait times (e.g., Cycle Time 1 + Cycle Time 2 + ...).

##### Individual Cycle Time (`Cycle Time 1`, `Cycle Time 2`, etc.)

* **Definition:** This refers to the **time it takes to complete a single specific task** or process step (e.g., Turning, Drilling, Tapping) on a single product unit.
* **Example:** If the individual processing steps take 30 minutes for Turning, 15 minutes for Drilling, and 10 minutes for Tapping, these are the individual cycle times for those specific tasks.

### 🚀 Cycle Time vs. Efficiency in Manufacturing [@Arcera]

Ever wondered how to measure and improve your manufacturing process? Let’s dive into two key metrics that drive efficiency: **Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT)** and **Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE)**!


#### 🔍 Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT)

This metric tells us how long it takes to produce each unit.

##### Formula:
$$
MCT = \frac{\text{Production Time}}{\text{Units Produced}}
$$

Understanding MCT allows us to identify delays and improve production speed. Reducing cycle time leads to quicker delivery and increased customer satisfaction!

##### Calculation Example:

Let's assume a production run takes 480 minutes (8 hours) and produces 60 units.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Define the variables
production_time_minutes <- 480 # Total time the process ran
units_produced <- 60

# Calculate Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT)
MCT <- production_time_minutes / units_produced

# Print the result
cat("Manufacturing Cycle Time (MCT):", MCT, "minutes per unit")
```

#### 📈 Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE)

This metric reveals the efficiency of the production process by focusing on the actual "Process Time" (value-added time) within the entire production period.

##### Formula:
$$
\text{MCE} = \left(\frac{\text{Process Time}}{\text{Production Time}}\right) \times 100\%
$$

**Process Time** is the time spent on activities that directly add value to the product. **Production Time** includes process time plus non-value-added time (e.g., inspection, waiting, moving).

Higher MCE means less waste and more value-added time in production. Aiming for a higher MCE drives leaner operations and cost savings.

##### Calculation Example:


```{r echo=FALSE}
# --- Define the range for Production Time (Total Time) ---
# Let's assume the total production time is between 400 and 600 minutes
min_production <- 400
max_production <- 600

# Generate a random total production time
production_time_minutes <- runif(1, min = min_production, max = max_production)

# --- Define the range for Process Time (Value-Added Work) ---
# The process time must be less than or equal to the production time.
# Let's assume the value-added work is between 50 and the generated production time.
min_process <- 50
max_process <- production_time_minutes # Upper limit is the randomly generated production time

# Generate a random process time
process_time_minutes <- runif(1, min = min_process, max = max_process)

# --- Calculate Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE) ---
MCE <- (process_time_minutes / production_time_minutes) * 100

# --- Print the results ---
cat("Total Production Time (minutes):", round(production_time_minutes, 2), "\n")
cat("Value-Added Process Time (minutes):", round(process_time_minutes, 2), "\n")
cat("--- \n")
cat("Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency (MCE):", round(MCE, 2), "%")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="MCT and MCE"}
