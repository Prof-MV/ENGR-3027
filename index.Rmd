# Introduction {-}

Why are we studying this?

  *	Defining and identifying manufacturing processes is critical to understanding the role that automation plays and how to program an industrial process line.
  * What are some examples of a manufacturing process?
  *	What do we have or use that is manufactured?
  *	What is the biggest manufacturing change that you have experienced so far?

  *	Processes have changed throughout the centuries and have been driven by the four Industrial Revolutions.
  
  *	First Industrial Revolution – Coal in 1765
    * This transformed society from an agricultural base to an industrial base. Processes became mechanized and rather than hand made, products were manufactured. The discovery of coal and the development of the steam engine and metal forging transformed the way goods were created.
    
  * Second Industrial Revolution – Gas in 1870
    *The discovery of oil and electricity fueled the second industrial revolution. The discovery of oil lead to the invention of the combustion engine and new steel and chemical based products entered the manufacturing streams. Technological advances in communication were driven by the invention of the telegraph and later the telephone. Modes of transportation developed with the invention of the airplane and automobile. These discoveries helped to drive the advent of mass production which forever changed how items were produced.
    
  * Third Industrial Revolution – Electronics and Nuclear Energy in 1969
    *The third industrial revolution is dominated by the development of electronics and the beginning of the age of computers.
    *Technological developments were centered around four pillars of science: telecommunications, biotechnology, information technology and energy engineering.
    
  *	Fourth Industrial Revolution – Internet and AI
    * The fourth industrial revolution describes the current era of digitalization, automation, and advanced manufacturing technology. It's characterized by the convergence of emerging technologies, such as robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 3D printing.

## Labs {-}
* Late penalty is 25% per lab session.
* Labs 1-5 must be completed before Week 7. 
* Bring your lab kit and PPE to every lab session.

## Assignments {-}
* 6 Assignments worth 2% each, for a total of 12%. 
* All are FOL quizzes, with at least one week open.

## Quizzes {-}
* 6 Lecture Quizzes and 6 Lab Quizzes.
* Quizzes are worth 0.5% each, for a total of 6%.
* Quizzes are given randomly throughout the term as a “pop quiz”.
* Quizzes are given at the start of the lab session (10 minute log in window) or at the end of the lecture.
* **You must be in attendance to write the quizzes.**

## Tests {-}
* During in-person lecture time (90 minutes). One midterm test worth 17%, one final test worth 25%.
* Both tests are cumulative and online, in-person.
* Closed-book with handwritten cheat sheet; details will be posted on FOL closer to the date.
* Kit calculators allowed.

## Other Grade Considerations {-}
In order to pass, two conditions must be met:
* Overall passing grade (50%).
* Attendance and submission of the mandatory labs (labs 1 though 10)

## How to succeed {-}
* Come to class and lab sessions Participate
* Complete examples given in class
* Do the homework and assigned reading 
* Attend office hours

## Cheating and Plagiarism {-}
Students must write their reports and assignments in their **own words**. Whenever students take an idea or a passage from another author, they must acknowledge their debt both by using quotation marks where appropriate and by proper referencing such as footnotes or citations. This includes non-published sources, such as work completed in previous years or a classmate’s work. 
**This includes the use of "AI" Technologies.**

## FOL {-}
* Lectures will be posted after class, as well as supplementary material.
* Assignments and lab manuals will be posted ahead of time. You will always have at least one week’s notice.
* All announcements will be made through the FOL course.

## Accessibility {-}
Please contact me if you require material in an alternate format or if any other arrangements can make this course more accessible to you.

Consider contacting Accessibility Services for specifics on accommodations that you may be eligible for.
