End-of-Chapter Questions
Conceptual Questions:

Explain why detection ratings are often harder to reduce than occurrence ratings
What is the difference between a failure mode and a failure effect?
Why should PFMEA be conducted by a cross-functional team rather than an individual engineer?
At what point in process development should PFMEA ideally be conducted, and why?

Calculation Questions:
5. Given severity = 8, occurrence = 6, detection = 4, calculate the RPN. If improved controls reduce detection to 2, what is the new RPN?
6. Two failure modes have RPNs of 120 and 150. Should the higher RPN always be addressed first? Explain your reasoning.
Application Questions:
7. Create a simple PFMEA for a coffee brewing process in a commercial setting (3-4 failure modes)
8. For a metal stamping operation, identify at least five potential failure modes and their likely effects
9. A process has an RPN of 240 (S=8, O=6, D=5). Propose three different improvement strategies and show the resulting RPN for each
Critical Thinking Questions:
10. Discuss the limitations of using RPN as the sole prioritization method
11. How would you handle a situation where team members disagree on severity ratings?
12. What role should PFMEA play in continuous improvement programs?
