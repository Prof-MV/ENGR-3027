## Types of automation in various manufacturing processes

-   Fixed automation – *large volume, single part productions*\
    Fixed automation is a system in which the sequence of processing (or assembly) operations is fixed by the equipment configuration. Each of the operations is the sequence is usually simple, involving perhaps a plain linear or rotational motion or an uncomplicated combination of the two; for example, the feeding of a rotating spindle

-   Programmable automation – *associated with batch production*\
    In programmable automation, the production equipment is designed with the capability to change the sequence of operations to accommodate different product configuration. The operation sequence is controlled by a program, which is a set of instructions coded so that they can be read and interpreted by the system. New programs can be prepared and entered into the equipment to produce new products

-   Flexible automation – *Real time, on-demand production*\
    Flexible automation is an extension of programmable automation. A flexible automated system is capable of producing a variety of parts (or products) with virtually no time lost for changeovers from one part style to the next. There is no lost production time while reprogramming the system and altering the physical setup (tooling, fixtures, machine settings). Consequently, the system can produce various combinations and schedules of parts or products instead of requiring that they be made in batches.

This flowchart provides a detailed, high-level overview of the sequential phases and functional teams involved in a **Process Plant Project**, from the initial detailed design and engineering phase through to final operation. It outlines the inputs, the core engineering disciplines, and the outputs required for construction and start-up.

### ➡️ Project Phases (The Timeline)

The diagram illustrates the overall project life cycle, which progresses linearly from left to right:

| Phase | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Detailed Design & Engineering** | The phase where all specifications, PFDs, P&IDs, and detailed drawings are created by the various engineering disciplines. |
| **Construction** | The phase where the physical plant is built based on the final engineering documents. |
| **Commissioning** | The phase of checking, testing, and verifying all systems and components to ensure they operate according to design specifications. |
| **Start-Up** | The phase where the plant is brought online and begins production. |
| **Operation** | The final, long-term phase of continuous production and maintenance. |

### 📝 Initial Inputs and Design Foundation (Top Section)

The engineering process begins by defining the scope and constraints based on several foundational documents and requirements:

* **Client Specifications:** Specific needs and performance criteria defined by the client.
* **Functional Requirements:** What the plant must be capable of doing.
* **Company Practices:** Internal standards and procedures.
* **Basic Design:** Initial conceptual and front-end engineering design work.
* **Design Codes & Standards:** Industry regulations (e.g., ASME, API, national codes).
* **Business Requirements:** Financial and operational goals for the plant.



### 📑 Core Engineering Deliverables

The initial inputs lead to the creation of core process documents, which form the foundation for all subsequent detailed engineering disciplines:

* **PFDs (Process Flow Diagrams) & H&M Balance (Heat & Mass Balance):** High-level diagrams showing the process path and material/energy flow.
* **Process Datasheets:** Detailed information and performance specifications for individual pieces of equipment.
* **P&IDs (Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams):** Detailed diagrams showing all process equipment, piping, valves, and instrumentation necessary to operate the plant.
* **Process Packages:** Documentation and specifications for specialized, self-contained units purchased from vendors.

These documents are overseen by the **PROCESS TEAM**, which coordinates with **SAFETY** and **PLANT OPERATION** requirements.


### 👷 Engineering Disciplines (The Disciplines Block)

The core process deliverables are then translated into detailed specifications and drawings by specialized engineering disciplines (the highlighted yellow blocks). Each discipline generates `Specifications + Requisitions + Documents + Equipment + Materials...` required for purchasing and construction.

| Discipline | Focus Area | Key Deliverables & Systems |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I&C (Instrumentation & Control)** | The brain of the plant. | Control & Safety Systems, HMIs (Human-Machine Interfaces), Logics, Specifications, and Documents for instruments and interface wiring. |
| **Piping** | The circulatory system. | Isometrics Drawings, 3D Models, Pipe Specifications, Fittings, Under Ground and Above Ground Layouts. |
| **EL (Electrical)** | The power system. | Specifications for Electric Power Feeders, Lighting, Motor Drives, MCCs (Motor Control Centers), Substations, UPS, and Electric Heat Tracings. |
| **Civil** | The foundation and infrastructure. | Foundations, Piles, Paving, Buildings, Structures, Roads, and general site infrastructure. |
| **Mechanic** | Static equipment (vessels). | Specifications for Vessels, Towers, Tanks, Silos, Fired Heaters, Heat Exchangers, Reactors, and Bunkers. |
| **Rotary** | Moving equipment. | Specifications for Pumps, Compressors, Turbines, Mixers, and Material Handling Items (Cranes, Loaders, etc.). |



### 📦 Output and Final Stages

The final output of the detailed design and engineering phase is a comprehensive set of documents:

* **Documents for Purchasing:** The `Specifications` and `Requisitions` generated by all disciplines are used by the purchasing department to acquire the necessary equipment and materials.
* **Documents for Construction/Installation/Commissioning:** The final drawings and specifications are used on-site to build the plant, test the systems, and move into the **Start-Up** and final **Operation** phases.
